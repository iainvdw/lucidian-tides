Powerful aboleth that enslaved drowned sailors and transformed them into the K't'haumi, including [[Backstory|T'hau]] and their friends.

To what purpose Nagh'Khun needed them isn't entirely clear to T'hau or their friends, but from the vague memories they have, it seemed Nagh'Khun was looking for something powerful on the bottom of the sea. However, it's not known if this was a specific location, an artefact or something else.

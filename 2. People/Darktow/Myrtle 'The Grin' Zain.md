![[myrtle-the-grin-zain.webp]]

An slightly older dwarven woman, a captain of the guard in [[3. Locations/Darktow Isle/Darktow]]. Self-assured, humorous and sassy.

White braids decorated with clasps of various precious metals extend past her shoulders, falling over the ornate breastplate she usually wears. Scars mark her chin and right cheek, showing that  she has quite some combat experience. Often tells grand tales about these scars, where she got them, and the unfortunate ends of her opponents that managed to land a strike on her.

She got her nickname 'The Grin' as she grins a lot telling her grand tales, and everyone listening to her stories could witness the unsightly state of her teeth lining that grin.

Has trained [[Backstory|T'hau]] for their first few months in Darktow as a fierce fighter.

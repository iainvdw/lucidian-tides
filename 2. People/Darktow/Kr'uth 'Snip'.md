![[kruth-snip.png]]

Former Aboleth guard, fled together with [[Backstory|T'hau]]'s group. Cocky, aggressive, ruthless.

Now a pirate sailing around [[3. Locations/Darktow Isle/Darktow]], raiding Concord vessels and guarding the waterways around Darktow Isle. Ruthless and violent towards opponents. Got the nickname 'Snip' as they once snipped off a head with their pincers during a fight.

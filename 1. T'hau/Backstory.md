## T'hau's appearance

![[shelly.jpg]]

T'hau is a crustacean-like creature, called the K't'haumi, with their appearance somewhat resembling that of a mutated humanoid crustacean with crab-like features. Their carapace is covered in spiky and bumpy protrusions, and barnacles grow from its back and shoulder. The colour of the carapace usually a spotted mix of blues, dark turquoise and browns, but can change colour to blend in with the features of their surroundings. When seen in the light, their carapace features a kind of pearlescent sheen when seen in the light. From their torso protrude four arms, two smaller limbs with nimble three-pointed claws, and two larger stronger arms featuring strong pincer claws.

As their hardened carapace provides all the protection they need, they're not fond of wearing additional clothing or armour. To carry around their items and weapons they wield, all they have is a backpack featuring four sturdy leather straps that clip together on their chest. The straps also feature some satchels and pouches for quick access to tools, weapons and potions. Around their hip is a leather belt, featuring two rapiers with grips slightly customised for their uncommon hands.

On T'hau's chest is a befriended starfish they named Marlak, orange of colour and a dark green pupil-less eye in the middle. T'hau has been regularly communicating with it telepathically for companionship and advice.

Being out of the water would make one expect crabs and starfish to dry out in the air, especially in the warm climate of Darktow Isle, but no such thing has happened to T'hau or Marlak. T'hau's gills remain moisturised and Marlak's body glistens with watery mucus. T'hau and Marlak have no idea how this is the case, but it does keep them accustomed to their surroundings.

## T'hau's story

### The escape

Around two decades ago T'hau used to be part of an underwater encampment of K't'haumi slaves. These slaves were bound in servitude to a mighty psionic aboleth, who herself was a powerful servant of Uk'otoa. Soon after the defeat of Uk'otoa, a powerful psionic surge spread over a large area undersea, causing a brief but long enough interruption in the psionic abilities of the aboleth, breaking the enslaving telepathic connection. This powerful surge not only affected the slaves, but also broke the control over the slavers and their guards, leaving them confused and incapacitated as the controlling hive mind was temporarily gone.

The slaves, suddenly awakened from their mental slumber, dozens saw their chance and fought their way out of the encampment, even managing to convince a few of the guards to come with them. As they escaped the underwater encampment, fleeing further into unknown regions of the deep sea, they encountered other dangers of the ocean along the way. Terrifying sharks, massive octopuses and other monsters of the sea picked quite some numbers of the fleeing group during the perilous journey, until there were no more than seven of them left. T'hau picked up a clamshell-shaped shield and a barnacle encrusted cutlass from one of the guards that perished fending off these creatures, and took it upon themself to become a protector of the fleeing group.

### A shadow above

Eventually the group reached shallower waters, seeing rays of sunlight clearly for the first time breaking through the water's surface, lighting up a beautiful and colourful coral reef. For all they knew, this was the first time in their active memories they saw something like this. Carefully emerging from the water and to scout their surroundings, they saw an island to the east. Not sure if they should make land yet, they hid among the reef for a while. After a few days, they saw a shadow moving overhead of them.

This shadow was cast by a small fishing vessel sailing nearby. A fishing net was thrown into the water and got stuck in the reef nearby. A sudden urge of curiosity got over T'hau, and they tried to free the net from the reef, trying to help the fishermen above. They gave a sharp tug on the net, which wasn't expected by one of the fishermen above, and he tumbled off the fishing vessel into the sea. Panicking in the water, their frantic movement got them stuck in their own fishing net as well. T'hau saw this happening and instinct told them to help the drowning fisherman.

Swimming as fast as they could, T'hau reached out telepathically to the fisherman, telling him he came to get him. Looking around the water as he heard this voice in his head, the drowning fisherman screamed all the air out his lungs as he saw this crab-like monstrosity quickly swimming towards him. Luckily for the fisherman, there was nothing to be scared of. T'hau caught the drowning fisherman, freed them from the net by cutting the net with their pincers, and brought him back to the surface. The group of fishermen still on the boat who were looking out for their crew mate, got quite the scare seeing this unfamiliar creature staring at them with two bulbous black eyes, holding their crew mate in their pincers. Thinking T'hau was going to attack them, they grabbed whatever tool they could use as a weapon, pointing daggers and harpoons at T'hau.

T'hau asked the fisherman in their grip to call out to them and let them know everything was alright. The fisherman was still a bit shaken about the whole situation, but considering he was freed and taken to the surface, he spoke to the other fishermen and told them to stand down. As they lowered their weapons, T'hau swam over to the fishing vessel and helped the fisherman on board.

T'hau started speaking telepathically with the fishermen, asking if they knew where they were. A short conversation later, the fishermen told T'hau that they were fishing in the Dragshallow Reefs, and the island was called Darktow Isle. Realising this creature could communicate with them, the fisherman saw an opportunity. The fisherman asked if T'hau would join them and sail back to the island to introduce them to the Plank Queen. T'hau told the fishermen there were more like him hidden in the water, and demanded they give them medical aid, food and shelter as well. Before the fishermen could even respond, T'hau called out to their friends and they soon all eventually emerged from the sea, and several crab- and lobster-like heads were now all looking at the fishermen.

Feeling overwhelmed by the number of sea monsters suddenly emerging from the water and the prompt demand from T'hau, the fishermen pulled out their weapons again. Aiming the pointy ends of their descaling knives, harpoons and tridents directly at T'hau's throat, the fishermen demanded what their intention was. Not very accustomed to these kind of encounters, T'hau's surprise at this response quickly turned into anger, yet remained calm. T'hau managed to grab several of their weapons in one fell swoop, snapping them in half with a pincer. Again, T'hau urged the fisherman that they had no intention of harming anyone, but would do so in defense. Reiterating on T'hau's demand, they explained that they were in dire need of food, medical attention and shelter, offering help in return this time.

Seeing how T'hau managed to disarm several of the fishermen with ease, the fisherman realised they didn't really stand a chance against T'hau, let alone several more of these creatures. Lowering their weapons and backing away slowly, they asked what it was T'hau wanted. T'hau still remained calm and intent of sailing with the fishermen to get help for his friends, and asked the fisherman for help again, adding a sarcastically polite "puh-lease" this time, trying to break the ice a bit.

Hesitant to bring all of these unknown creatures back to [[Darktow]], they offered to take back T'hau for an audience with the Plank Queen and try to make their plea. T'hau assured his friends that he would be back for them after meeting the Plank Queen and urged them to not stray too far from here so he could find them later again.

On the ship, T'hau tried to make some conversation with the fishermen, who were still a bit creeped out by the deep chittering voice in their minds because of T'hau's telepathy. When the fishermen left T'hau unattended for a bit, T'hau started wandering around the small vessel and found some of the fish they caught, a few barrels worth of fish, clams, and the sort. Hungry as a seahorse, T'hau engorged themself on the fish, unaware that this was the fishermen's haul to sell in Darktow. It was only after having eaten through half a barrel of fish, that the fishermen noticed. Very annoyed at T'hau's sudden appetite, they urged T'hau to take a seat on the bow of the vessel, so they could keep an eye on him during the trip back.

### Meeting Yucalia

Entering the port of Darktow, T'hau focused his bulbous black eyes and took in the sight of the town as they sailed in. Houses, shacks, huts and storerooms built on the sandy beach and against the rocky cliffside of the isle. Hearths and lanterns lighting up the insides of the houses, light peering through gaps between the wooden planks of the buildings. Light grey plumes of smoke emanating from various pipes and chimneys. Boisterous laughter could be heard emanating from various taverns and inns, amongst some more foul language. Dockworkers could be seen offloading cargo and plunder from several ships.

After docking at Darktow's port, rumour spread quickly around town and soon the masses flocked to the docks to glance at this unknown creature. The crowd's reactions were mixed, some were curious, but fear could also be seen on some of their faces. The fishermen escorted T'hau through the town, towards the beach where Plank Queen Yucalia held her court. Walking through town, T'hau saw a great many folks of different origins, most of which he had never seen before in the deep ocean.

The fishermen took T'hau to the beach, where the current [[Plank Queen Yucalia]] resides. There, the group told the story of how T'hau rescued the fisherman stuck in the net from drowning. Then they introduced T'hau to Yucalia, when T'hau surprised her a bit when establishing a telepathic link to tell their story. T'hau relayed their story to the Plank Queen; where they came from, what happened, how they came here, et cetera. Others observing this conversation only heard T'hau's odd chittering, clicking and growling noises, but Yucalia still seemed to understand this creature and talking back to them.

Yucalia wanted to understand where these creatures came form, as she had never seen these before. T'hau tried their best to explain what they could remember, but sadly there were these black holes in their memory that they could not remember. Still, T'hau remains ever curious about what happened and deep inside wants to get to the bottom of this, with or without help from the Plank Queen.

After this short conversation, Yucalia asked a plain and simple question: what would T'hau and their friends have to offer to Darktow in return. T'hau's answer was equally simple: they can breathe underwater, have a strong carapace and multiple arms, so they could offer help with fishing, construction work and fight fiercely if need be. Requirements for shelter would also be quite modest. A simple cave with some access to the seawater would do fine. Mud and sand wouldn't be any issue, having lived on the ocean floor for so long.

Giving it some thought, Yucalia granted them some shelter, food and medical aid, as long as they promised to find some work to do in Darktow as soon as they were able. As T'hau's specialty seemed to be in fighting, Yucalia assigned a fierce pirate of her personal guard to them for training.

Quite relieved at this news, they went back to the ocean to find their friends in the Dragshallow Reefs where they relayed the news that they could stay here and recover, in return for their services around town. Their friends, somewhat dismayed at now having to be in service to someone else again after having fled their forced servitude, finally agreed to stay here for a while and recover, and see what it was like for a while.

Over the next few weeks and months, the K't'haumi troupe settled themselves in a shallow cave near some tidepools on the beach, building a small wooden shack in front of it as the entrance. This cave provided them with a place to stay and offered some space for storage. The folks around town started referring to this shack on the beach as [[The Muddy Hut]], and soon the K't'haumi adopted this nickname as the official name of their new home.

It is during this time that T'hau starts having recurring nightmares...

### T'hau's recurring nightmare

They're on a large three-master ship sailing across the sea, standing on the foredeck. Up ahead brew a massive storm, they're heading straight for it. The sky slowly turns a deep dark turquoise, clouds swirling overhead, rain pouring over the deck and winds hammering the sails. 

Suddenly, the sea start swirling around the ship, and a massive maelstrom appears. Dark shadows of an unknown nature can be seen quickly moving through the water. The ship keens to the side and heads straight into the maelstrom. A mast breaks. Screams. The ship finally capsizes. People fall overboard. More screams. Bodies in the water. Water turning red.

When T'hau also falls from the ship shortly after, time seems to slow down. The seawater foams angrily below, droplets hang almost still in the air. They're falling. More shadows below, still moving fast while everything else slows down. Ever so slowly falling into the water. Eventually, almost at the water surface, the foaming sea clears up for a short moment and T'hau sees a reflection of a face in the water. Every dream it's a different face. Sometimes T'hau seems to recognise one, but more often than not, they're unknown faces.

Then, the reflection disappears, and a massive maw and tentacles lurch from the water, pulling them below. Water fills their lungs. Gasping for air. Everything goes dark.

### Echoes from the deep

For the first few months in Darktow, T'hau attended regular training sessions with a fierce pirate woman named [[Myrtle 'The Grin' Zain]], a fairly large dwarven woman. Myrtle got this nickname because of the unsightly state of her teeth. Black, brown and missing teeth lined her smile. Honing their combat skills, it was during these training sessions that T'hau discovered their abilities. 

When T'hau was honing their senses for combat during the combat training sessions, in the moments of highest concentration, sometimes a vaguely humanoid form of foaming ocean water, kelp and coral appeared nearby. These manifestations lingered for a short while, and then disappeared again. T'hau started called these manifestations "echoes from the deep".

Over the next few months, T'hau discovered that they had some control over these echoes and starting focusing on controlling this echo. T'hau was more and more able to control the form and movement of these echoes. After some time, they were able to manifest this echo during their combat training sessions, managing to outmaneuver their opponents.

One day however, the echo manifested a familiar face in the watery surface making up its humanoid form, staring intently at T'hau. A face that they seemed to recognise from their recurring nightmares. T'hau wasn't able to control this echo like they usually do, but that moment lasted ever so short, before the face disappeared and the echo was back under their control.

Since that bizarre event with the echo, something weird started happening with T'hau's nightmares as well. In rare occurrences, when they would wake up after having one of their nightmares, their echo stands next to them. It stares intently at T'hau with the face they just saw in the reflection in the dream, before disappearing again after mere seconds.

### The Muddy Hut

![[muddy-hut.jpg]]

The unusual appearance of T'hau and their friends attracted quite a few folks who were interested in their origins, visiting [[The Muddy Hut]] to get acquainted. Some of these folks returned on a regular basis and stuck around for casual conversation and drinks. Over time, this got more and more folks attracted to The Muddy Hut. As the place was located in a shallow cavern that flooded during high tide, it attracted mostly folks of a more aquatic origin, like merfolk, water genasi, sea elves, triton and tortles.

As the number of visitors and frequency of their visits increased, this eventually led to the conversion of The Muddy Hut into a tavern of sorts. Expanding deeper into the cavern, and constructing the hut further out on the beach and into the sea, it allowed for more patrons to visit and stay.

T'hau wasn't directly involved in running The Muddy Hut, but it always has a place to stay for them, as they were one of the original folks to live here. When they make landfall after a pirate raid or exploring mission, it is one of the first places they usually visit, and tell grand stories about their adventures

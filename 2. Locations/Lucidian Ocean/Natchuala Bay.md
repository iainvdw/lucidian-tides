A popular fishing spot near [[Nicodranas]]. Fishermen saw bones drift up there recently and they now avoid the place, as they think it's cursed.

We sailed to the bay to investigate, and were ambushed by two merfolk.

After defeating the merfolk, we learned that they were scammers from Karakala trying to lure people into the crevasse.

The crevasse contained symbolism recognized by [[T'hau]] as it was the symbol of their oppressors. Deeper into the crevasse they found a chest containing various types of pearls.

The crew is rudely awakened by a town crier, yelling about how people should bring forth information on Louise de Montfort and her connection to a crime against a noble family. There’s a thousand gold reward for it. 

Doloris chases after the town crier to try and catch up with him. She pretends to be annoyed with him because it’s so early, he seems willing to move along as long as Doloris gives him some money. She finds some gold in her pocket and pays him, so he takes his leave. 

She gets a closer look at the pamphlet the crier is holding. It’s a drawing of Mal, with some wanted lettering detailing the amount of money that [[Guillaume de Montfort|de Montfort]] family is willing to spend. It also says ‘any and all information inquiries redirected at Montfort Estate’ with a name attached, Cecelin Auvrindar. 

Doloris returns to the ship and shares the news with the rest of the group. Mal shares that she does recognize Cecilin’s name: it’s her old nanny who now runs most of the de Montfort household. 

The crew discuss what to do about this. Mal suggests that the others check out the tannery as planned, she will find [[Obaya]] at the temple to Melora and warn her about Alvaro coming. [[Big Neela]] will accompany her, as the others don’t like Mal setting out on her own. 

Doloris, T’hau, Stormbreaker and Rayna set out towards the tannery. They spot the crier again, who seems to be getting some abuse from the people around; they don’t seem to be his biggest fans.

They eventually reach Nivor’s Tannery. The square here is filled with large, round tubs, most of them empty. Several have a soot stain around them, seemingly indicating a blast radius. The surrounding bricks have acid damage. 

T’hau hears a voice coming from inside the building, heads in to check it out. He finds two humans and a halfling there, who are hoisting a huge clay container off a wagon, and it seems to be going wrong. Willow, Proaker and Finni are the halfling and two humans. Willow calls out to T’hau for help and with the four of them, they manage to keep the clay container upright. Willow shares that this clay container is how Bram, her mentor, plans to save the tannery. There’s a black pudding inside, which helps with the cleaning process here in the tannery. 

They are joined by a gnome, Bram Shudderstone. He is the chief alchemist of the tannery. The crew say they’re here to help investigate the explosion. Bram shares some more information about the explosion. Three people died, a lot of other workers are recooperating. 

Somebody dropped something in one of the baths, which caused the explosion. It was done on purpose. Many eye witnesses saw a dwarf do it. Bram did some alchemical research after the explosion, which helped him determine what happened. He shows his notes on that to Rayna, as well as samples and compounds. 

As he’s showing these notes to Rayna, she spots two creatures on a beam above in the building. She goes over the notes, which make a lot of sense to her. She deduces that whatever was thrown into one of the baths, wasn’t something that they logically also have here at the tannery. The compound that was thrown in, sulphur, is hard to obtain as it’s regulated by the Clovis Concord. One way to get it is through the black market. 

Bram says that the mine has been trying to buy them out, especially the outside part. They wish to bring in more machinery. He can’t think of anyone else who may want to do damage or harm to the tannery and the people working there. 

Rayna brings this information to the others, positing that maybe someone is trying to frame someone from the mine. Either that, or someone from the mine walked up in clear daylight and very publicly caused an explosion. 

They ask Willow about what her brother saw, Doloris asking if it was Overseer Flintguard. Willow says it wasn’t; her brother saw a female dwarf and she knows Flintguard, it wasn’t him.

Doloris feels a little woozy, seeing what she thinks is her father in a dark corner of the tannery. He winks at her and calls her little heartbreaker. Doloris sits down on the floor for a moment, before joining the others who follow Willow as she leads them to her brother. 

They make their way to Willow and Vennic’s house. Willow offers everyone seats and drinks. Vennic describes what he saw. A female dwarf coming from the direction of the mine, dropping clumps of yellow-ish, blue-ish material down one of the baths. She seemed nervous, possibly looking for the fastest way out. She was very pale, had a big ring through her nose and was carrying what looked like mining gear. 

Stormbreaker asks if anyone wants the mine implicated. Vennic knows that a lot of people in the Skews want it gone; it’s obnoxious and some of the dwarves are rude. The mine has many stakeholders, Lady Sherome is one of them. Vennic asks Willow if Bram seemed more jittery: he’s always been a big proponent of getting the tannery up to ‘modern’ standards with magic. 

Concluding the conversation with Vennic, the crew decides to head to the mine. Willow offers to introduce them to Overseer Ulmaet Flintguard, as she’s seen him around a bit. When he sees them approach, Flintguard thanks Stormbreaker for stepping in. Flintguard says two of his men also got hurt during the explosion. 

Flintguard says it may not be a dwarf who also works in the mines. A lot of people in the neighborhood are looking to pin it on them. A number of the vats at the tannery are now useless. He thinks this may finally be the moment Benja stops being stubborn, though he’s not planning on approaching Benja with an proposal for that right now.

Stormbreaker shares the description of the dwarf that Vennic provided them with. Flintguard says none of his workers look like that. They don’t employ any gray dwarves; they give them a bad name. A lot of them are twisted by the time they spend underground. The group recalls that [[Kirour Grimblade|Kirour]] was also a gray dwarf. 

Stormbreaker then asks Flintguard if he knows if anyone wants to harm the mine. He says many people don’t like them being here. He names Eda, but he doesn’t think she’s the type to do something like that. There are stakeholders, like Lady Sherome, who may have enemies, but Flintguard doesn’t know much about that. 

He says they simply discovered a vein of platinum whilst the city was away in Avernus and they decided to exploit it for the betterment of the Concord. Part of their funding comes from the Concord itself; they feel its a good way for Nicodranas to become financially stable again. 

Flintguard excuses himself. The crew and Willow brainstorm about who may be suspects. Stormbreaker and Doloris remember seeing Bram in the Blushing Mermaid as they were passing through. They discuss whether or not to talk to the [[Zhelezo]], the staff at the Blushing Mermaid or to Bram himself.

This discussion ends with the crew saying Willow should invite Bram for drinks to the Blushing Mermaid. They head to the tannery, where Bram and Proaker seem to be dividing up the puddings into smaller puddings. 

Bram asks the crew about their investigation. They invite him for drinks, which he says he’s not interested in. He seems to recognise the name of the Blushing Mermaid when Willow mentions it. He’s instantly uncomfortable. 

As they ask further questions, he says alcohol and revelry has been helping him sleep ever since he got back from Avernus. Doloris asks if he happened to make any deals in Avernus, which he says he didn’t, but there seems to be something to it. Stormbreaker asks if anyone’s threatening him. Bram slowly seems to break and panics, casting a spell. He turns invisible after kicking the lid of the clay container, combat ensues. 

After defeating the three mephits and the black pudding, everyone starts chasing after where they think Bram disappeared to. Rayna and Doloris both run through Rayna’s moonbeam, which is still in the doorway where she left it. They manage to lock Bram in the stables. He knocks on the door, asking if he can come out.

They let him. He asks to tell his story before they send him to the authorities. He says since he returned from Avernus he’s been leading a second life. Enjoying a drink and gambling. He discovered there were underground bars when he was in the Blushing Mermaid, there were really good gambling matches there, where he racked up a bit of a debt.

He was eventually told that the Myriad was asked to see to it that the mine could be expanded. They knew he was in a position to do something. To pay of his debt to the Myriad he came up with the plan to cause this explosion. It was supposed to happen during the night, but they didn’t listen. He told them what compounds to use and what vat to throw it into, but other than that, he wasn’t physically involved. It was all Tyra, the grey dwarf. She was there with a kenku and two albino tieflings when he made the deal. He figured that, with the vats outside gone, he could talk Benja into modernizing. 

Willow asks where Tyra is. Last time Bram saw her was in the Black Tankard, a fighting pit in the Undercellar. She usually hangs out with Witness, the kenku previously mentioned, as well as the two albino tieflings: Ivory and Ash. Witness is high up in the Myriad.

The crew decide to deliver Bram to the Zhelezo in the Restless Wharf. He confesses everything to them. Stormbreaker asks Willow to fix his hammer, which she says she’ll do her best to do, offering him a magical infusion on the hammer as well.

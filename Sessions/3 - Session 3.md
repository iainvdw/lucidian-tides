As we are about to get off the ship, the captain informs us that [[Doloris]] has some personal matters to attend to, and will be going her own way today. The rest of us are to go into [[Nicodranas]] and see what we can learn from [[Tamulia]].

Three kids play in the docks as we get off the ship, ask us if we're new here. [[T'hau]] turns around and talks to them telepathically. Kids are a bit curious. Ask us if we're new here and need a tour, but [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] mentions she is from Nicodranas and already knows the place, so we turn the kids' offer down.

We continue to the Fortuitous Serenade Inn and Casino to find [[Tamulia]]. Inside, there's just a handful of patrons at this time of day. [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] talks to the bartender, a bearded older man, and orders us some drinks. Inquires if [[Tamulia]]'s around, bartender replies she performs each night. Mal asks if she's around because we'd like to talk to her, bartender nods and goes to find Tamulia in the back.

The bartender walks in with [[Tamulia]] a few moments later, and recognises [[Stormbreaker]]. She takes us to her chamber to talk in private and asks us to close the door behind us.

She starts talking about her role with [[The Revelry]]. A while ago, The Revelry got her out of a pickle, for which she is thankful. As a ways of returning the favour, she has been hired by [[Plank Queen Yucalia]] to be our eyes and ears here.

Together with a few orphans and street urchins, Tamulia has been carefully gathering details and mapping out the inside of the Golden Chain Vault. Stormbreaker and Tamulia run us through a few details of the place:

- The Golden Chain is ruled by a human male, by the name of Commander Da'urlo Vidorant. Apparently he's a massive fan of dwarven culture, dressing into their fashion. Is the 

We ask Tamulia for some more details on the security of the place, and we learn there's a changing of the guards every four hours on the balcony. Apparently, the vault holds 360k gold, intended to pay for the [[Clovis Concord]] war fleet they're building. Every so often, an armoured cart goes there to pick up the funds to pay for the next instalment, bringing it to the shipyard.

Tamulia asks [[Stormbreaker]] to assist her and work on a few final details of the map, presenting it to us after a few moments.

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] also inquires about Gellan Primewater. He is a councillor in Nicodranas. Also asks about the Montfort family, also councillor, runs the Open Quay. Mal reveals she has had some business with them before.

Places to visit to find more [[The Revelry|Revelry]] associates: Low Lantern, Blushing Mermaid.

We finish the conversation with Tamulia and head upstairs. Get some more drinks and find a booth. Talk about the work we need to do here: sell cargo, find contacts, get equipment, scout vault.

Rayna asks Stormbreaker if he's with us now and he replies that he has nothing else to do and would like to.

We go to The Wide, a market square, and get us some equipment. Decent new clothes for [[Stormbreaker]], and some cloaks to stay hidden.

On the edge of the square, we spot some Golden Chain soldiers pulling an armoured cart stopping at a blacksmith called The Eternal Flame. A heavy box is loaded into the cart. A fire genasi couple comes out of the smithy. The male is consoling the woman. Rayna seems to recognise the couple and walks towards them. The cart moves onwards, not stopping anywhere else.

Rayna starts talking to the couple and says she recognises them from Ank'harel. Asks what the issue with the guards was about. Apparently they operated without a license for The Wide. First time Rayna hears about a license in The Restless Wharf. Couple hoped to start a business in Nicodranas, a city that needs rebuilding, but keep bumping into issues.

The couple invite us in and offer us some tea. Get some equipment from them, and they're grateful for our patronage.

Captain relays some more options.

We go to scout the vault. We walk up town and walk

South wall isn't patrolled. Roof has two guard. Patrol in front of building. Larger patrol of six men, one in command, walking in a line up and down the perimeter of the building, east to north to west and back. Nearest house is across the street. One house is in a bad state, no lights on.

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] finds a head of a mace, still glowing and smouldering. Seems to be a remnant relic from the heavy fighting when [[Nicodranas]] was in the Nine Hells. [[Stormbreaker]] picks it up to see what happens. Feels hot. Starts bursting into flame when he starts to shake it. Hands it over to [[Mallory Calder|Mal]]. Might be a good option to reforge and turn into a new magic weapon.

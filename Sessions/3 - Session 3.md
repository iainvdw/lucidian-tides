As we are about to get off the ship, the captain informs us that [[Doloris]] has some personal matters to attend to, and will be going her own way today. The rest of us are to go into [[Nicodranas]] and see what we can learn from [[Tamulia]].

Three kids play in the docks as we get off the ship, ask us if we're new here. [[T'hau]] turns around and talks to them telepathically. Kids are a bit curious. Ask us if we're new here and need a tour, but [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] mentions she is from Nicodranas and already knows the place, so we turn the kids' offer down.

We continue to the Fortuitous Serenade Inn and Casino to find [[Tamulia]]. Inside, there's just a handful of patrons at this time of day. [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] talks to the bartender, a bearded older man, and orders us some drinks. Inquires if [[Tamulia]]'s around, bartender replies she performs each night. Mal asks if she's around because we'd like to talk to her, bartender nods and goes to find Tamulia in the back.

The bartender walks in with [[Tamulia]] a few moments later, and recognises [[Stormbreaker]]. She takes us to her chamber to talk in private and asks us to close the door behind us.

She starts talking about her role with [[The Revelry]]. A while ago, The Revelry got her out of a pickle, for which she is thankful. As a ways of returning the favour, she has been hired by [[Plank Queen Yucalia]] to be our eyes and ears here.

Together with a few orphans and street urchins, Tamulia has been carefully gathering details and mapping out the inside of the Golden Chain Vault. Stormbreaker and Tamulia run us through a few details of the place:

- The location of the vault also serves as a magistrate and court room. There are cells to hold the convicted prisoners.
- Inside the vault, there is approximately a total of 360,000 gold, intended to pay for the war fleet [[Clovis Concord|The Clovis Concord]] is building.
- Every so often, armoured carts go to the vault to load up gold to pay for the next instalment. These carts are well guarded by Golden Chain guards. Carts go to the shipyard to deliver the payment.
- The Golden Chain is ruled by a human male, by the name of Commander Da'urlo Vidorant. Apparently he's a massive fan of dwarven culture, dressing into their fashion. Is the owner of the Auric Gauntlet of Elâ€™bashaar, which he claims to have stolen from a Marquesian soldier. Has his office upstairs, next to the vault.
- Every four hours, there is a changing of the guard on the balcony upstairs, outside of the commander's room.

Tamulia asks [[Stormbreaker]] to assist her and work on a few final details of the map, presenting it to us after a few moments:

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] also inquires about Gellan Primewater. He is a councillor here in Nicodranas. Also asks about the De Montfort family, also councillor, runs the Open Quay. Mal reveals she has had some business with them before.

Finishing up the conversation with [[Tamulia]], we ask her for good places to visit to find more [[The Revelry|Revelry]] associates. She mentions two taverns or inns: the Low Lantern, and the Blushing Mermaid. Mal mentions to Tamulia that a bad tip from The Blushing Mermaid led to a trap from [[Clovis Concord|The Concord]].

Finally, [[Tamulia]] mentions that she considers her debt to [[The Revelry]] to be paid in full now, so she can go back to concentrate on her performances. Any other future inquiries with her will cost The Revelry money. She does say to extend her thanks to the [[Plank Queen Yucalia|Plank Queen]], for helping her when she was in a bind.

After the conversation with Tamulia we head back upstairs. We get some more drinks and find a booth in a quiet spot for us to sit down and talk. We start listing the things we need to do here: sell our cargo, find some Revelry contacts, get some equipment for the heist and scout the vault.

[[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] asks [[Stormbreaker]] what he is going to do now. Asking if he is part of our crew now, he mentions that he has nothing else to do now, but is gladly staying around to see through to the part where we take the money from the vault. He does point out that it is a bit odd to welcome him in, as they just got to know him to be a defector. The rest mentions that he defected for a good cause and make nothing further of it.

After some drinks, we start heading to The Wide, a large market square in Nicodranas. There, we stock up on supplies and some equipment. Rayna offers to buy Stormbreaker some new clothes, and we get us some cloaks to stay hidden when scouting the vault later.

[[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] is the first to spot that, on the edge of the square, some Golden Chain soldiers are pulling an armoured cart around. They stop at a blacksmith called The Eternal Flame. A heavy box is loaded into the cart, and a fire genasi couple comes out of the smithy. The husband is consoling his wife, who is in tears. Rayna seems to recognise the couple and starts walking towards them. They see the cart starts moving onwards, not stopping anywhere else.

Rayna starts talking to the couple and says she recognises them from Ank'harel. They introduce themselves as Qon and Wuyiva. Asks what the issue with the guards was about. Apparently they operated without a license for The Wide, and the guards showed up to demand quite a hefty sum for said license. This is the first time Rayna hears about needing a license to work or trade in The Restless Wharf. Couple hoped to start a business in Nicodranas, a city that needs rebuilding, but the local authorities seem to have thrown hurdle after hurdle at them. The couple invite us in and offer us some tea.

Rayna talks to them some more, that she recognises them from when she was a bit younger. It takes the couple a few moments, but when Rayna mentions her parents' shop, they recognise Rayna too. To try and make up for what just happened, the crew offer to buy some equipment from them.

After we did our shopping, we start heading back to our ship. On the ship, the captain asks us how things went, and we relay what we found out. The captain then relays some options for us. He has been talking to some people and has lined up some potential buyers. [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] then points out that we intend to speak to Mr Primewater, and the captain agrees that may be our best lead, suggesting we seek him out the next day.

Captain also shares that he learned something else. Every night around 3 AM, a thick fog sets around Nicodranas, ever since it returned from Avernus. The crew figure they migh

We go to scout the vault. We walk up town and walk

South wall isn't patrolled. Roof has two guard. Patrol in front of building. Larger patrol of six men, one in command, walking in a line up and down the perimeter of the building, east to north to west and back. Nearest house is across the street. One house is in a bad state, no lights on.

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] finds a head of a mace, still glowing and smouldering. Seems to be a remnant relic from the heavy fighting when [[Nicodranas]] was in the Nine Hells. [[Stormbreaker]] picks it up to see what happens. Feels hot. Starts bursting into flame when he starts to shake it. Hands it over to [[Mallory Calder|Mal]]. Might be a good option to reforge and turn into a new magic weapon.

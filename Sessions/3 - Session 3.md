We get into Nicodranas, beautiful colourful city.

Three kids play in the docks as we get off the boat, ask us if we're new here. T'hau turns around and talks to them telepathically. Kids are a bit curious. Ask us if we're new here and need a tour, but [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] is from Nicodranas and we turn the kids down.

We continue to the Fortuitous Serenade Inn and Casino to find Tamulia. [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] talks to the bartender, orders some drinks. Inquires if Tamulia's around, bartender says she performs each night. Mal asks if we can talk to her, and bartender goes to find Tamulia in the back.

[[Tamulia]] walks in, and recognizes [[Stormbreaker]]. She takes us to her chamber and asks us to close the door behind us.

She starts talking about her role with [[The Revelry]], she has been hired and is our eyes and ears here.

Together with some orphans, Tamulia has been carefully mapping out the Golden Chain Vault. Human male rules the Golden Chain, Commander Da'urlo Vidorant. Massive fan of dwarven culture. We're going to plan a heist to rob them blind. [[Stormbreaker]] and [[Tamulia]] work on a few last details on the map. Also serves as a magistrate and court room. There's a changing of the guards every four hours on the balcony. Vault holds 360k gold. 

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] also inquires about Gellan Primewater. He is a councillor in Nicodranas. Also asks about the Montfort family, also councillor, runs the Open Quay. Mal reveals she has had some business with them before.

Places to visit to find more [[The Revelry|Revelry]] associates: Low Lantern, Blushing Mermaid.

We finish the conversation with Tamulia and head upstairs. Get some more drinks and find a booth. Talk about the work we need to do here: sell cargo, find contacts, get equipment, scout vault.

Rayna asks Stormbreaker if he's with us now and he replies that he has nothing else to do and would like to.

We get into Nicodranas, beautiful colourful city.

Three kids play in the docks as we get off the boat, ask us if we're new here. T'hau turns around and talks to them telepathically. Kids are a bit curious. Ask us if we're new here and need a tour, but [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] is from Nicodranas and we turn the kids down.

We continue to the Fortuitous Serenade Inn and Casino to find Tamulia. [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] talks to the bartender, orders some drinks. Inquires if Tamulia's around, bartender says she performs each night. Mal asks if we can talk to her, and bartender goes to find Tamulia in the back.

[[Tamulia]] walks in, and recognizes [[Stormbreaker]]. She takes us to her chamber and asks us to close the door behind us.

She starts talking about her role with [[The Revelry]], she has been hired and is our eyes and ears here.

Together with some orphans, Tamulia has been carefully mapping out the Golden Chain Vault. Human male rules the Golden Chain, Commander Da'urlo Vidorant. Massive fan of dwarven culture. We're going to plan a heist to rob them blind. [[Stormbreaker]] and [[Tamulia]] work on a few last details on the map. Also serves as a magistrate and court room. There's a changing of the guards every four hours on the balcony. Vault holds 360k gold. 

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] also inquires about Gellan Primewater. He is a councillor in Nicodranas. Also asks about the Montfort family, also councillor, runs the Open Quay. Mal reveals she has had some business with them before.

Places to visit to find more [[The Revelry|Revelry]] associates: Low Lantern, Blushing Mermaid.

We finish the conversation with Tamulia and head upstairs. Get some more drinks and find a booth. Talk about the work we need to do here: sell cargo, find contacts, get equipment, scout vault.

Rayna asks Stormbreaker if he's with us now and he replies that he has nothing else to do and would like to.

We go to The Wide, a market square, and get us some equipment. Decent new clothes for [[Stormbreaker]], and some cloaks to stay hidden.

On the edge of the square, we spot some Golden Chain soldiers pulling an armoured cart stopping at a blacksmith called The Eternal Flame. A heavy box is loaded into the cart. A fire genasi couple comes out of the smithy. The male is consoling the woman. Rayna seems to recognise the couple and walks towards them. The cart moves onwards, not stopping anywhere else.

Rayna starts talking to the couple and says she recognises them from Ank'harel. Asks what the issue with the guards was about. Apparently they operated without a license for The Wide. First time Rayna hears about a license in The Restless Wharf. Couple hoped to start a business in Nicodranas, a city that needs rebuilding, but keep bumping into issues.

The couple invite us in and offer us some tea. Get some equipment from them, and they're grateful for our patronage.

Captain relays some more options.

We go to scout the vault. We walk up town and walk

South wall isn't patrolled. Roof has two guard. Patrol in front of building. Larger patrol of six men, one in command, walking in a line up and down the perimeter of the building, east to north to west and back. Nearest house is across the street. One house is in a bad state, no lights on.

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] finds a head of a mace, still glowing and smouldering. Seems to be a remnant relic from the heavy fighting when [[Nicodranas]] was in the Nine Hells. [[Stormbreaker]] picks it up to see what happens. Feels hot. Starts bursting into flame when he starts to shake it. Hands it over to [[Mallory Calder|Mal]]. Might be a good option to reforge and turn into a new magic weapon.

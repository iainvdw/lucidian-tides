Combat. They defeat the Grung, one of them escaping. 

[[T'hau]] speaks to the yuan-ti, Mal picking up one of the Grung’s staff, deducing it’s magical (Staff of Swarming Insects). The yuan-ti explain they came here because of a calling from their respective deities, by themselves. Then, they encountered the Grung. Nesalli saw visions of dying nature, heard a voice on the wind. Zihu saw the bigger moon, Catha, being overtaken by Ruidus, and heard a similar voice on the wind. This is why they left the Fane.  

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] gives the Staff of Swarming Insects to Rayna, then goes [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] to trying to figure out the riddle.

Re-reading the riddle and some more of the writings, Mal figures out the four circular stones can be moved so they match up with the compass and the map. One of them is already in the right position. [[Stormbreaker|Storm]] and T’hau move a second one into place, which makes the runes on one of the arches on the side light up, a grey silvery glow in the middle of it.

T’hau sends their echo through to see where the arch leads. Looking through its eyes, T’hau sees everything in black and white. They can see back through the portal, seeing ‘ghosts’ of the others. There’s still jungle around, but the trees don’t have any leafs. The echo returns unharmed. 

As it seemed like there wasn’t much there through the portal, they decide to try and keep moving the other stones. All four lock into place, both archways lighting up. The silvery light starts to leak out of the portals towards the stonework in the center, meeting in a flash of blinding white light. 

Rayna, who is in the center when this happens, disappears. Mal, Storm and T’hau head towards the center, but can’t seem to find her. Mal suggests they turn one of the stones away from the right rune and then back again, but [[Doloris]] points out there’s a way through the archways, through which she sees Rayna.

Rayna finds herself elsewhere. There’s text, speaking of divine tests. 

> Hone your soul in tests divine, 
> By entering this holy shrine. 
> This test in shadow lays you bare. 
> What secrets have you feared to share?
> More text speaks of facing your darkness. 

The others all head through the portal and join Rayna. The door closes behind them, so does the portal. Doors open in front, leading through into another room. Light radiates from the ceiling, murals decorating the walls. Each figure depicted is sundered, a gap where their hearts should be. Regardless, all figures seem to be smiling. The murals are very detailed. 

They head into the room, Storm taking a closer look at one of the murals. He notes a perfectly white feather inside the gash across the heart of the mural depicting a woman with fiery hair running from guards. 

Recognising the fiery one as Rayna, Mal approaches the mural that reminds her of herself. She reaches into the gash, finding a piece of cloth. She reaches for it, finding herself transported to a vision. She’s holding a music box, hiding underneath a desk with her younger sister. Hidden underneath the desk still, she hears her father speak a foul language, the scent of sulfur filling the room. 

The others see Mal fall to her knees, eyes rolling up. Doloris heals her, but it doesn’t snap her out of it. Doloris suggests she might be ‘facing her darkness’, Rayna pointing out it seems strange these murals may be depicting them specifically. T’hau goes with the theory, finding ‘their’ mural, picking up a lens from the gash across its heart. They note their companions looking around as if they’re not in the temple anymore, looking through the lens to see if that changes anything. 

They spot a ghostly figure in the distance, blowing an arrow at Rayna, who drops. The others jump into action. They then spot another figure, without a face. Coral and anemones come to live underneath its cloak. “It’s been a long time since we saw each other last, Desmond. Come with me if you are ready to learn,” the voice says.

Mal, in her vision, recognises some of the sentences her father is using. The devil mentions Rakesh and the Lavish Chateau. Mal realises this isn’t an actual memory. She steps up from underneath the desk, looking at a mirror through which her father is communicating with a grotesque golden devil. She throws the music box at the mirro, trying to break it. The mirror cracks. 

Storm and Rayna discuss what to do next, now having watched Mal and T’hau react to their respective murals. 

T’hau is still seeing a vision of their friends getting ambushed. The figure says T’hau should come with them if they’re ready to learn. T’hau is aware this is somewhat of an out of body experience. The figure’s three red eyes in a row remind them of what they know about aboleths. The figure claims to have all the answers T’hau seeks, as they were the ones who created T’hau. 

They speak of a soul that embodies T’hau, claim they know who sank T’hau’s ship. The choice is theirs: follow him, or save their friends. T’hau can still see their ‘friends’ under attack by yuan-ti, a large skeletal creature now also attacking them. 

T’hau takes the figure’s hand, feeling a sharp tug down, returning to their senses right as Storm points out they should just wait to see if Mal and T’hau come back.

T’hau shares some of what they saw with the others, pointing out it does seem like they are to be facing their fears, their darkness. Rayna immediately says she’s not interested.

Mal faces her father, her younger sister by her side. She calls her father out, who doesn’t seem to know what to say. He then says they don’t have much time; the devil she just saw has claim to her sister’s heart.

In that moment, Mal snaps out of it. She’s still holding on to the cloth, but it’s different now; she’s holding a moonstone lion figurine. T’hau still has his lens.

Something changes in the rooms, a divet appearing in both of the doors. Text appears about offerings. T’hau and Mal are ready to put their ‘offerings’ down, but they decide to wait as Storm and Rayna approach their respective murals, ready to face their fears.

Storm reaching into the gash on his mural, touching something sharp. It’s a tusk. His vision takes him back to his youth. He’s just passed a trial, the fifth of six, which in his tribe means he’s ready to join some of the elders on their hunts. The herd’s elder stands behind him, an older woman. “Get to the other side,” the woman says, gesturing to a fast flowing river. “That’s where the jungle is.” 

He attempts to cross, it’s somewhat of a struggle. As he starts going down, he hears the woman’s voice. The woman casts a spell, which changes the river’s current, moving Storm back to the shore where he came from.

Rayna finds herself facing a massive blaze, aware that she’s the one who caused it. She hears screams from people fleeing the inferno. She sees her adoptive father in the blaze, armed guards approaching, but she also sees a door opening, away from the blaze. This door leads to a portal, her mother appearing in the opening. Rayna runs towards it. “You made a wise choice darling, this place does not want you.” 

She sees a city made of brass. Her mother claims she’s now ready to meet her real father. Rayna objects, saying she has real fathers. Her mother corrects herself, saying biological father instead.

Her mother tells her she should stop running, come to where she’s actually accepted. Rayna says she has a place where she is now, somewhere. She can hear her adoptive father, Naveed, calling out again. She excuses herself, runs back into the blaze, intending on saving her real dad.

Storm looks up to the old woman, who urges him to try again. He asks her why. “This is the way it’s supposed to be.” According to the ancient traditions, the herd. Storm points out he barely knows this lady, but still tries to cross the river again. This time, he rages.

He makes it across this time, which seems to leave the woman dumbfounded. “It seems you have earned more responsibility. I stand corrected.” She seems both disappointed and perplexed. Storm flips her off before walking off. He hears ‘always question authority’, before returning to reality. 

Rayna runs towards the flames, towards her father. Naveed screams at a burning window, through a window, Rayna can see her other father, Kish. Rayna runs inside. She finds Kish, guiding him back outside and to safety. Naveed hugs both of them. From behind them, Rayna can hear questions from guards that are arriving, asking who caused this. 

As she returns, the feather Rayna was holding has turned into a red lotus.

Mal distracts guards at Lavish Chateau

Rest climbs over fence, on other side of chateau.

T'hau asks what's to expect in the chateau. No one really knows what to expect here, no experience or knowledge about demons or Avernus.

Wait for Mal, then continue into the main hall.

Mal senses some fiendish presence nearby. Something weird dripping on the above floor, and something shiny on the floor. Doloris investigates the shiny thing on the floor, and finds a coin with a symbol of Evandra, the Changebringer. As she tries to pick it up, a sharp pain pierces her mind, and images of all the things the coin has seen flash before her eyes.

Mal and T'hau investigate the en suite bathroom. Bathroom with brass bath tub, stinky water. Noticeable markings, footsteps in the dust, lead to the bath. As we investigate the bath and the dirty water, all seems fine.

Stormbreaker andRayna enter the next room. Large amount of bird droppings, hole in the ceiling, towards the attic. Rayna figures the bird droppings are parrot's, but says the room is boring and they move on.

Doloris investigates the earlier room, where Mal sensed the fiendish presence. She touches the wall. In the bathroom, Mal and T'hau notice the bath water ripple and shimmer with a different image for a moment. T'hau remembers the Dwarven henchmen of Kirour had a ring tied to fiends, which Doloris has in her pack. They ask Doloris over, and the bath water turns into an image of black stone, purple flames.

Stormbreaker and Rayna find the next door, which is locked. They manage to open the lock, and find a room with a lectern, with seemingly blank parchment. Parchment has grooves in it, which they figure could be made readable through some coal.

T'hau asks everybody over to come check out the bath tub. We show them the water and Rayna decides to put her hand in the water, and senses something tugging at her mind. Her hand reaches deep into the bath tub, beyond where the bottom would be. We figure this looks like a portal.

Mal tries to make the text on the paper readable using her forgery kit. Contract is signed by:

- Vidorant
- Montfort
- H. Ribbond

Stormbreaker inspects a few more rooms. Finds a room with a black goopy puddle, seemingly bodies having melted and fused together. Suddenly, a loud slam as a window opens and a breeze is felt across the room. Female halfling spirit is seen through the window. Stormbreaker calls out to Doloris, young halfling woman, throat slit.

Rayna gets a spell going to detect any magic presence. As soon as that is up, inspecting the bath water makes her think that by draining the water, the portal would be gone. As she put her hand in before, she figures that the water might be from the river Styx. She kinda panics a bit when she figures that her hand had been in hell for a short moment.

Suddenly, Doloris and Rayna hear floor boards creak. Two people, a young woman and man, enter the building through the same door where we entered. They take the stairs up to the bathroom. Burst through the door.

Mal and the woman recognise each other, Mal's sister, Lucienne. Lucienne asks if Mal finally decided to join the family business. Introduces the man as her betrothed, [[Eliander de Matiz]].

Asks us to step back as she shows her hand, having a similar ring to Doloris'. She intends to step through the water, as she has some business. Rayna steps back towards the bath tub, turns around and casts thunderwave on the water, splashing it around. This causes Lucienne to step forward in panic, shouting "No!". Mal stops her with her rapier. As he does that, Lucienne transforms into a fiendish being with horns and bat-like wings on her back.

Eliander looks at his betrothed, and asks "Now?". Lucienne, now looking annoyed, replies with "Yes, you idiot!". Then, Eliander continues to casts fireball on the group.

Combat ensues.

Document falls from the floor during combat, and Doloris picks them up.

Eliander is killed by T'hau. Three more imps are summoned and then Lucienne vanishes. 

Two Zhelezo arrive, but Stormbreaker is set on fire by Rayna and tries to scare the guards off impersonating Asmodeus, managing to scare them off.

T'hau tries to figure out what's going on, remembering nothing from the morning onwards. The crew tell them that they're affected by the Styx water.

The crew decide what to do with the body of Eliander. Doloris can't mend the bullet holes to fake the cover story of him being attacked by a devil. We decide to burn the body beyond recognition, and hide it on the goopy remains downstairs to mask it being the remains of the noble.

We hear guards running around the chateau. We spot an empty back alley and decide to make our escape. Rayna stumbles during the exit, and a single guard notices a Rayna and Doloris.

We get back to the ship, but we can't read all of it as it's in Infernal.

Contract signed my Guillaume de Montfort, shepherding souls into the nine hells.

Another contract, signed by Guillaume and two elven brothers production of 20 ship figure heads a year of special wood, that will slowly siphon away souls. Wood is briarblaze thorn.

Mal mentions this isn't unlike the deal she expected her dad to make.

We share this information with Eda and Gallen, to get them in the loop.

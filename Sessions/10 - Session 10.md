Mal distracts guards at Lavish Chateau

Rest climbs over fence, on other side of chateau.

T'hau asks what's to expect in the chateau. No one really knows what to expect here, no experience or knowledge about demons or Avernus.

Wait for Mal, then continue into the main hall.

Mal senses some fiendish presence nearby. Something weird dripping on the above floor, and something shiny on the floor. Doloris investigates the shiny thing on the floor, and finds a coin with a symbol of Evandra, the Changebringer. As she tries to pick it up, a sharp pain pierces her mind, and images of all the things the coin has seen flash before her eyes.

Mal and T'hau investigate the en suite bathroom. Bathroom with brass bath tub, stinky water. Noticeable markings, footsteps in the dust, lead to the bath. As we investigate the bath and the dirty water, all seems fine.

Stormbreaker andRayna enter the next room. Large amount of bird droppings, hole in the ceiling, towards the attic. Rayna figures the bird droppings are parrot's, but says the room is boring and they move on.

Doloris investigates the earlier room, where Mal sensed the fiendish presence. She touches the wall. In the bathroom, Mal and T'hau notice the bath water ripple and shimmer with a different image for a moment. T'hau remembers the Dwarven henchmen of Kirour had a ring tied to fiends, which Doloris has in her pack. They ask Doloris over, and the bath water turns into an image of black stone, purple flames.

Stormbreaker and Rayna find the next door, which is locked. They manage to open the lock, and find a room with a lectern, with seemingly blank parchment. Parchment has grooves in it, which they figure could be made readable through some coal.

T'hau asks everybody over to come check out the bath tub. We show them the water and Rayna decides to put her hand in the water, and senses something tugging at her mind. Her hand reaches deep into the bath tub, beyond where the bottom would be. We figure this looks like a portal.

Mal tries to make the text on the paper readable using her forgery kit. Contract is signed by:

- Vidorant
- Montfort
- H. Ribbond

Stormbreaker inspects a few more rooms. Finds a room with a black puddle, seemingly bodies having melted and fused together. Suddenly, a loud slam as a window opens and a breeze is felt across the room. Female halfling spirit is seen through the window. Stormbreaker calls out to Doloris, young halfling woman, throat slit.

Rayna gets a spell going to detect any magic presence. As soon as that is up, inspecting the bath water makes her think that by draining the water, the portal would be gone. As she put her hand in before, she figures that the water might be from the river Styx. She kinda panics a bit when she figures that her hand had been in hell for a short moment.

Suddenly, Doloris and Rayna hear floor boards creak. Two people, a young woman and man, enter the building through the same door where we entered. They take the stairs up to the bathroom. Burst through the door.

Mal and the woman recognise each other, seemingly family. Woman asks if Mal finally decided to join the family business. Introduces the

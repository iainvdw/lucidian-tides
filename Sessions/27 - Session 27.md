Zimu leads the group in through the underwater entrance, Rayna having turned into a snake. They come upon an archway, which Zimu isn’t sure of where it leads, as well as a door that seems blocked by algae and other growth. Storm, with the help of T’hau, opens that door and they continue onwards, snake!Rayna scouting ahead to get a lay of the land.

She passes by an urn in an alcove, with an axe embedded in the wall above it, though strangely the axe seems to cast the shadow of an arm instead. Doloris is interested and asks Mal to take a look at it, who realises there’s undead energy about it: the axe has likely been stuck in this very wall since the Calamity. Best not to touch it.

They keep going, passing by the snake pit that Zimu previously described to them. Rayna, aided by Stormbreaker, heads down there to try and speak to the snakes and win them over to their cause, before realising she can’t actually speak to snakes. The others lower a rope and pull her back out.  

At Zimu’s directions, they continue towards the audience chamber. Zimu explains there’s an antechamber before it. Mal, now disguised as a yuan-ti, and Zimu, head into said room, with snake!Rayna slithering in before them, exploring up ahead. In the antechamber, they find five men whom Mal recognises as people who used to work for her father. She knows they are Hollow Ones; people without a soul, and also knows their souls are likely in Hell. 

Before she can relay any of this to the others, snake!Rayna has found her way into the audience chamber, where a large, snake-like creature can be found, as well as three scantily clad snake women, all gathered around a strange pool of liquid.

Rayna is spotted by the large figure and one of the women addresses her, scolding her for having wandered too far from Dr Dolex’s venom pits. Rayna turns around and tries to leave, but the larger figure follows her out into the antechamber, where he spots Mal and Zimu. He recognises Zimu, saying he thought he was dead, but doesn’t recognise Mal, which rouses more suspicion.  

Things are tense for a moment, and a fight almost breaks out, but Storm manages to calm tensions down after he, T’hau and Doloris enter the room as well. They speak to the large figure, Talesh, who eventually explains to them that the five men in the antechamber are here because they’re stirring up shit, and part of the reason the people here are seemingly siding more with Astus. He mentions speaking water, which is what the five men brought, and brings Storm into the audience chamber, showing him the pool of liquid on the floor. 

From the pool, the familiar face of Alvaro stares back, urging Talesh to go through with the plan. They step back, Storm managing to remain unseen by Alvaro, but the way he tenses makes it clear to Talesh that Storm knows who this man is. They speak, Storm stating outright they’re here for a dagger, which Talesh says is currently in Astus’s possession. 

Storm heads back to the others, telling him what he was just told and what he just saw, Mal now also sharing that she recognises these men as those who worked for her father before: they are not good men. Storm himself recognises some of them as well, as people who were part of the Concord navy alongside him.  

Talesh wants the crew to deal with the five men, which they are somewhat hesitant about, Storm pointing out they’re not assassins. This leads to a discussion, which Mal eventually ends, knowing these men are not good men, and stabbing her sword through the neck of the one she remembers doing particularly heinous things. 

There’s a brief scuffle as the other four men put up a fight, but they’re relatively easily dealt with. Storm calls Mal out, to which she asks him to trust her when she says these are not good men.  

With the scuffle over, Doloris asks Talesh what the plan is that Alvaro wants him to stick to. He explains how this temple they’re in is one of three. If they lift the jungle curse upon this place, the temple may function again in conjunction with the other two places. This would help him gain control over Nicodranas.

Talesh further says he doesn’t want to work for Alvaro: he would rather be a prisoner, than be under someone’s boot.  

They discuss a plan of attack when it comes to Astus, Talesh explaining that some thirty other yuan-ti followers will likely be in the room with him. He says Astus will likely be up on a balcony, which Storm and Mal are eager to take advantage of. Talesh then says that he could sound an emergency gong, which would likely get at least most of the followers running to safety.

They agree this is enough of a plan, so the others head in through to where Astus can be found and then wait for the sound of the gong. As the gong sounds, they rush in, and find themselves in a larger room, with Astus indeed up on a balcony.

Below, in a pool of blood, there’s an undead snake creature, with four of the followers remaining to put up a fight as well.  

Combat ensues, during which Doloris grows increasingly frustrated by the others running away so she can’t heal them, but eventually they defeat Astus, the undead snake creature, as well as the four others. With the fight over, Doloris moves over towards Astus’ body, picking up the dagger he dropped.

As she does so, she hears a voice speak in her mind, which eventually introduces itself as Sizlifeth. When Doloris explains this to the others, Mal points out that isn’t the name of the daughter, who’s soul they expected to be in the dagger.  

As they’re discussing this, Rayna and Mal start picking up on the sound of footsteps approaching, and as they look up, a number of yuan-ti emerge from the entrance to this room. Storm calls out to them, pointing out they’re working together with Talesh.

[[Doloris]] approaches her mural, finding a smooth gemstone within the gash across the mural’s heart. Her vision takes her to close to her ancestral home of Brokenbank. She is running towards her childhood friend, Zima. They play catch, Doloris’ friend throwing the ball a little too far, towards the cliff’s edge. She goes looking for the ball, finding it stuck in a bush a little way down along the cliff.

She considers using her wings, despite her father having warned her against doing so, as people may look at her differently. She pops out her wings regardless. 

Grabbing the ball, she flies back up. Zima seems to think this is cool, but Doloris also spots another figure; a blonde woman. The sight of Doloris seems to scare this woman, who runs towards her son, Zima, pulling him away from Doloris. Doloris manages to calm her down a little, the woman then asking her how she’s able to do this. Doloris talks about what happened to her, pointing at her scar. 

The mother pulls Zima away from Doloris, who calls after him, telling him she still has the ball they were playing with.  

Doloris wakes from her vision, the gemstone she first touched unchanged. As she looks around, she catches sight of the two yuan-ti, recognising their eyes: these are Neferia and Zima. They tell her she was in their visions too, and the two seem baffled as they realise they’re related. They talk about how the process of being turned into yuan-ti apparently had more of an effect on them than expected.

Neferia talks about the vision she saw, about how she was handed a map. She’s been here before, she’s prayed at the Briarblaze. She brought her son along and she doesn’t think she should have. She recalls what’s through the other door a misty maze, with a room with an angel at the end, which allows one to pray at the heart. Once they did that, their map was gone, and they were left in the jungle. 

Neferia then turns to [[Mallory Calder|Mal]], asking her what year it is. Apparently the last time she was here, was over six years ago. She did what the group is trying to do, but then her map and compass were gone and she was snatched by yuan-ti.  

The group discusses this, deciding to keep going. Everyone moves forward and puts their offerings down at the door Neferia pointed out, a door opening, revealing a swirling miasma of mist. Neferia and Zima decide to stay back, as they have a lot of catching up to do.  

Storm takes the lead, the others following closely behind. Their footsteps sound muffled and Storm can spell gunpowder in the distance. As [[T'hau|T’hau]] follows after [[Stormbreaker]], they don’t see him. Glowing in the mist, T’hau sees three glowing eyes in the mist, way up ahead. Mal sees Storm and T’hau disappear into the mists, then hears voices, her sister giggling. Doloris sees everyone disappear as well, the smoke she’s stepping into seems of a holy divine light. As [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] steps in last, she can feel heat around her. 

Separated, each member of the crew tries to find their way through this mist. Using the map to shed some light on the mist around her, Mal manages to clear some of the mist and notices patterns of two angels and a child. 

Storm is the first one to get out, finding himself in an oval room, having just emerged from another door. At his feet is the horn he placed as an offering, though it now has intricate carvings and gold and silver trimmings. In the middle of this room, he sees a floating angel. The angel seems to know there’s more of them coming. 

Doloris, praying to her god, finds her way to Storm as well, following the beacons of the lanterns he lit. Mal is the next to spot the torches as well, following them in. Doloris finds her gemstone now changed as well, the color is now purple with deep cerulean veins through it. Mal’s lion statuette seems to come to life for a moment, then changes into a sabre. 

T’hau is the next to make it out, finding their lens in front of them. It seems to have changed as well, adored with tiny eye-like symbols. With Rayna not there yet, Mal asks if Storm’s horn actually makes noise, thinking it might draw her attention. It does, but the horn, which turns out to be a Horn of Blasting, also damages the portal. Rayna makes it through just in time, finding her lotus again, a light now glowing above it.  

With everyone inside, the angel tries to draw their attention. Artimitei, is what the angel introduces herself as. She asks for their names, recognising the name Doloris. She says Ukaviel is her late wife, which is who mentioned Doloris. She speaks of something happening, it was Ukaviel’s fault their daughter Anahita got taken by the followers of Zehir. That they now have to do all this with the maps. She thought the jungle and the magic of the Wildmother and Changebringer would be enough to keep the agents of Zehir trapped and busy for an eternity. She wanted to show their daughter the Wildmother’s beauty and grace, allowing her to leave, but she ignored warning signs of more activity, more worshippers of Zehir. Artimitei claims it’s not right for Ukaviel to be punished for this long, but it was bound to have consequences.

Artimitei stayed to keep the heart safe. She made the maps, sent them out to all seven temples of the Wildmother and Changebringer. She’s reluctantly the only warden of this prison. Doloris warns of others that want to come here, with ill intentions.  

They talk about how the crew found the map, how they came here to try and keep the heart safe, as other people are after it. As they speak, Doloris recalls Ukaviel mentioning a way to redemption for her, Artimitei mentions saving their daughter’s soul might help, but that Ukaviel hasn’t spoken to her about this. 

Mal asks about how the prison works. During the Calamity, Zehir and the Strive Emperor were locked here, along with one of their champions, the Blood River. The Changebringer was hurt, the Wildmother wept at the loss, trees sprouting from her tears. Her magic brought the Changebringer back up; the two of them withdrew from battle before they were more badly hurt. Zehir and the Strife Emperor escaped, but the Blood River stays here. 

Artimitei says that if Ukaviel was here, and their daughter was here, they would have enough energy between the three of them to permanently reconfigure the maze so no one would have to continue keeping watch.  

The crew discusses their options, deciding to go get Neferia. Artimitei asks if any of the group can reach out across a long distance, Doloris saying she can. Artimitei then suggests that Neferia stay here to pray, Doloris can then reach out if something goes wrong in the Thane. She asks Neferia if she would be okay with sending Zimu with the crew to guide them through the jungle. She’s torn about this question, turning to Doloris, saying she would blame her if anything happened to her son. Doloris promises to do her very best to keep Zimu safe.  

They head back the way they came, the mists now gone, the portraits of the two angels and a child now clearly Artimitei, Ukaviel and their daughter, Anahita. Neferia joins the group back for a moment, saying goodbye to her son after asking him to navigate them back to the Thane. Neferia heads back, Zima begins leading the way out, the crew following him out. 

They spot [[Mudgraw]] taking a nap, T’hau waking him up. Mudgraw agrees to come with them, Zimu beginning to lead the way.  

They travel, coming across a group of six very large boars, one of them seemingly snacking on a corpse. They decide to go around, Rayna’s magic helping the group keep quiet. They come closer to where they need to be, Zimu talking the group through some of the options for approach. There’s a main entrance to the pyramid like temple, there’s also a back entrance that’s guarded, as well as an underwater entrance that he thinks isn’t guarded.

They discuss what way to go, Storm asking if they’re heading into a camp full of enemies, or if there are innocents there. The yuan-ti tend to kidnap others and turn them into yuan-ti, those people aren’t here willingly. They talk about their approach, wondering who to go for. They discuss going for the ‘heads of the snake’, Storm asking if they could maybe ask for an audience with the leaders. Zimu isn’t sure this will work. They’re looking for the kris, which is wielded by Talesh. He resides in the throne room. Astus resides in the religious room.  

They eventually decide to go for the underwater entrance. It ends up in one of the nests, which should be quiet during the daytime and has a lot of room for hiding. This would lead into a room with a large pit, which then heads into the temple proper.

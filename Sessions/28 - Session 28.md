During past few days at sea, letting my mind go over the visions Thau encountered in the temple.

Find myself at familiar cliff, stare into the sea, call of the void. See human feet, my own feet. Etienne calls my name. Waves come to a stand still. Turn around, see Etienne. Walk towards her, still standing still. Red glow coming down from the cliff. Put my hand on her cheek. Remember this cliff is in Brokenbank. 

Turn back to the red glow, see floating at cliff level the three eyed stranger they saw in the temple. Sourceless voice greets me as Desmond. Visions I saw there were not theirs, but of my own initiation. Creature says T'hau is unique in the sense that they have the ability to recall memories. None of the others of my kind seem to have this ability. Creature wants me to come back to them as the creation of Ogrorlo. Creature confirms that Ogrorlo is dead, like we learned in the ruins in [[Natchuala Bay]]. In return, Thau would be richly rewarded, that they would be returned to their former self, but also restore the other souls that make up T'hau's current existence. Creature says that if they want that, they should follow, and starts lowering themself back towards the sea.  T'hau asks if this dream is real and truly their memory, creature confirms. T'hau hesitates for a moment, but then turns back to Etienne, blows her a kiss. Then, they let themself fall backwards off of the cliff while saying that they're sorry they have to do this. As they fall backwards, they see a reflection of a face in the water of a young dark-skinned man with brown eyes.

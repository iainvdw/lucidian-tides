The yuan-ti that come running in are unconvinced by Storm’s words and they all ready their bows, taking shots at the group. This knocks Storm and Doloris unconscious, the others scrambling to try and keep them safe as Talesh walks in, who isn’t necessarily helping them either. 

There’s tension as the yuan-ti talk amongst themselves, most of them unsure as one of their leaders was just killed. Doloris, after Rayna manages to heal her and Storm, points out Talesh was the one who told them to do this. This prompts another volley of arrows as tensions between the yuan-ti rises even more. 

Realising they’re in no shape to fight more people, the crew start looking for a way out. Rayna spells out the issue with the yuan-ti power struggles, then says they’re leaving, ushering everyone out the door.  

They manage to escape the ziggorat and start finding their way back to the temple. They rest up briefly, despite Stormbreaker claiming he’s fine and saying his organs have shifted. Doloris tells the others what the dagger told her. They eventually keep going, finding their way back to the temple. 

Nasali jumps up and hugs Zihu, the angel looks at the others with big eyes, asking if they have it. They tell her they do, but Mal points out that there’s another entity of sorts inside the dagger as well.

They decide to finish the prayer, then take a look at the dagger. The angel closes her eyes and hovers and eventually something appears in the center of the room. A golden circle with thorns and roses, within it a bright white light made up out of dozens and dozens of animated hands, reaching up to form a flame. Nasali and Mal start the prayer as Storm and Rayna excuse themselves from the room.  

The prayer comes to an end, spectral vines covering the room. A quiet comes over the room, and Mal feels like she’s flowing. Mal stares into a bright light, feels an embrace, a connection to the Wildmother she has not yet felt before. For a moment, she feels connected to the entire Lushgut Forest. A moment later, the vines retreat back into the heart, completing the prayer. 

Artimitei confirms the prayer is completed, then says she would be lying if she wasn’t looking forward to seeing her wife and child again. Doloris reaches out to the voice within the Long Fang of Night, who greets her by calling her the God Botherer. Refers to Melora as the nature bitch. Doloris asks Sizlifeth if they collect souls; they confirm they can indeed do that once they’ve bonded with their wielder. There are souls imprisoned now. Doloris asks for them back, specifically Ukaviel and Anahita. Sizlifeth seems reluctant to part with them.

Doloris asks what the price for two souls is. The voice becomes more pressing, speaking of what Doloris cares for the most, prying into her brain. Sizlifeth asks for an angel in return. It asks her to give up her faith, which Doloris agrees to. 

The moment she agrees, she can instantly feel changes take over her body. The last thing she hears from the weapon is: “A promise is a promise”.

Two lights shoot out of the weapon which quickly turn into small vortexes in this chamber.  

Artimitei speaks to Doloros about the sacrifice she knows she just made, confusing the others, who only saw Doloris tense slightly, but didn’t hear any of her conversation. They ask Doloris to explain and after some prodding, Doloris admits that she believes this was the mission she was asked to complete: safe Ukaviel and her daughter. In exchange, the entity in the dagger asked her to give up her faith and pledge loyalty to Zehir instead.

The angel pours water out of a water jug onto the two vortexes, the shape changing as Ukaviel reveals herself, a familiar sight to Doloris. Ukaviel reaches out to Doloris, saying she’s happy that Doloris did this for her. “I see her strength wane in your eyes,” she continues, before seemingly offering Doloris some mental protection. She goes on to say she doesn’t know how to reverse the sacrifice Doloris made for her, but she will always keep Doloris on the righteous path. 

Artimitei and Ukaviel embrace and speak for a moment in Celestial. Artimitei says she needs to regain some strength before she can bring Anahita back as well. 

Doloris asks what will happen now, Artimitei and Ukaviel promising they will protect the Briarblaze Heart from now on, without it needing human prayer. Ukaviel then also promises she will find Doloris’ father, sharing his soul hasn’t passed through any domains, so he cannot be dead.

Artimitei turns to the others, thanking them for what they did. She asks if there’s anything she can do in turn, Rayna and Storm asking if Alvaro were to turn up here, they kill him. Mal asks them to promise to protect Doloris, which they say they will, Ukaviel also saying she will look into the dagger. Mal suggests she can look in their ‘mortal’ libraries as well.  

Artimitei and Ukaviel then ask for some privacy, the others happy to give it to them, asking if there’s some place for them to get some rest. They are pointed to a room with beds as well as food. 

They discuss Alvaro’s plans and how Zehir and the yuan-ti force ties in with them. They deduce that he would’ve likely send the yuan-ti at Nicodranas so that he and his forces could ‘swoop in’ to ‘save’ the city. 

The conversation then turns to Doloris, who explains how she should have died when she was six. She woke on a boat, and Ukaviel was there, telling her it essentially wasn’t her time yet. Ukaviel saved her life; she owes her everything. Doloris feels like the debt is now paid. 

She goes on to say she doesn’t feel much different; except the warmth is gone. She says she isn’t sure if she can heal anymore, which Storm decides to put to the test. 

They realise she can still heal, but it’s not as potent as before. As they retire for the night, Doloris asks if sleep will bring her warmth back. Mal promises her they’ll make sure it does.  

The following morning, they get ready to head back to the ship. They are provided with a way to get there by the angels. Nasali and Zihu ask to come with the crew, the crew suggesting some places for them to stay. Mudgraw says they would have a place in the tortle village should they wish to stay there.

The crew says their goodbyes to Mudgraw as well as the two yuan-ti, who decide to stay at the tortle monastery. They ask Doloris to come visit if she can, which she promises she will. 

Soon, the crew find themselves back aboard the Serpent’s Tide.  

They tell the captain they succeeded in why they came here. He shares the Plank Queen contacted him yesterday, her suggestion is they come back to Darktow and she’s calling a conclave. The situation in Nicodranas and such hasn’t improved. The conclave likely means a big decision will have to be made. 

They set sail to Darktow.

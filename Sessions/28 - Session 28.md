It is 21 days of travel to [[Darktow]]. 

[[T'hau]] contemplates what they saw in the temple, pondering on the questions of where they are from and who made them. They dream of a cliff, wondering on what it may be like to fall down. As they look down, they see human feet and in the distance, they hear Etienne call out to them. They turn towards [[Etienne de Thauville|Etienne]], walking towards her. She seems frozen in time, like everything else around them. The only movement T’hau spots is the red glow from below the cliff. 

T’hau recalls this is one of the cliffs overlooking the far side of the harbour of [[Brokenbank]]. As they look back towards the cliff, they see the three glowing eyes of the strange figure they’ve seen before. The creature is floating at eye level, water dripping off it. T’hau turns to face them, asking them what they want. The creature says the visions in the temple weren’t of their initiation. They were fuelled by T’hau / Desmond’s eagerness for the truth. The fact that T’hau has access to ‘past lives’ is apparently remarkable. They speak of T’hau’s echoes, as well as their dreams. Mention Ogrorlo as Desmond’s maker. 

T’hau says they only wish to know who they truly are. Which of their dreams are true. Which of the faces they see are theirs. The creature lowers itself into the cliff, seemingly daring T’hau to take the plunge. Before doing so, T’hau asks about the memory they’re in, if it is of his true self. The creature confirms this: it is not the shaper of this memory, only of this conversation.

T’hau turns back to Etienne one last time, blows her a kiss, apologises, then lets themselves fall backwards of the cliff. Just before they hit the frozen water, they see their own reflection. As they hit the water, they awake from their dream.

Doloris takes some time to try and figure out the entity within the dagger, Sizlifeth. She was one of Zehir’s earliest followers. She was slain on the battlefield by the Stormlord. Her master kept her alive in this weapon by offering up one of his fangs. There are many souls inside the dagger, which the wielder of the weapon can use, but Sizlifeth thinks Doloris isn’t ready for that yet.

Sizlifeth asked Doloris to convert to Zehir because it is who she serves. She could not have served someone who worships the Wildmother. Doloris says she served the Wildmother for decades and she feels close to her. Letting her go may be difficult. Sizlifeth asks about this, but Doloris says it’s too early to have that conversation. 

Louise seeks out Doloris to speak about the Wildmother. She admits she doesn’t understand why Doloris made the choice she did. Doloris explains that it didn’t feel like a choice in the moment - Ukaviel saved her a long time ago, she felt like it was always her purpose to save her in turn. 

As it was once upon a time Doloris who brought Louise to Wildmother, so Louise promises to do her best to return that favor. Doloris says she feels like she can’t feel the ocean breeze like before, so Louise uses Druidcraft to try and enhance the breeze a little. They agree that as long as they have faith, they may be able to figure this out.


Stormbreaker very awkwardly asks Louise and Rayna to join him for drinks later that night. Something about oceans and plants. They both join him later that night for more awkward conversation, drinks, cards and whatever else.


T’hau spends time with his Tome of Understanding. 


Eventually, they reach the island of Darktow. Lit lanterns illuminate the white harbour of the island. Those familiar with Darktow know the lanterns represent the dead, the families of the deceased the ones lighting them. Rayna tells Stormbreaker about some pirate things he should keep in mind.
As they dock the ship, they recognise some of the ships already docked, amongst them the Blind Sphinx, the Dragonfly and the reclaimed Siren.
The crew decides to show Stormbreaker the sights as it doesn’t seem time for the Conclave of Sails yet. 


They split up once reaching Sundry Square, Louise heading off to find everyone some local snacks. Doloris checks in with Necky at the Siren’s Call and is told that Councilwoman Donagal and Ava are staying in Darktow, having arrived aboard the Dragonfly. Nicodranas is currently under the protection of the Blood Sails. 
Necky mentions rumors of the Plank Queen wanting to buy off a local monster. Doloris then buys a health potion of him and thanks him for that as well as the gossip.  
T’hau seeks out Daigon’s Forge to find some upgraded guns. Storm and Rayna join him. T’hau arranges for an upgrade for his guns whereas Storm finds some fancy pikes. Daigon also tells them to seek out Ugon, an orcish fellow who may have weapons of the magical variety to sell. He’ll be at the square tomorrow. 


Everyone meets back up in the square. Lou hands out fish snacks. Doloris shares with T’hau that the tents where the crab people reside got raided. T’hau wants to check it out and the others are quick to offer to join them. 
People are salvaging what’s left of a main building. Amongst said people is Ava and T’hau recognises Pock, a large crustacean creature who seems to be in charge. Some of the crew of the Blind Sphinx were invited here, but started trashing the place. Ava corroborates this story. Pock says he doesn’t want them to seek any kind of revenge, which T’hau and Doloris are quick to not really agree with.
They’re offered some strong liquor for helping out with cleaning things up a bit. 
After talking some more with Pock - and Lou catching Ava up with what’s been going on - they decide to help with cleaning for a bit and then see if they can’t get some drinks with the crew of the Blind Sphinx. 


They find out the captain of the Blind Sphinx is at the Bloated Cup and head there. As they walk in, they’re greeted by some other pirates, congratulating them for their exploits in Nicodranas. The table that seems to hold the crew of the Blind Sphinx doesn’t respond to them at all. 
Doloris knows that the Blind Sphinx hunts Concord and merchant alike and it’s somewhat of a rogue ship. It sells in a lot of different ports, but also dumps it’s stuff at Ole’ Thicke’s. There’s rumors of the captain and his crew burying their plunder for rainy days. Doloris also heard a rumor that Blind Sphinx got their tips of who to hunt out of Stillben in Tal’dorei, a hotbed for the Myriad. 


They chat briefly with their own captain, then decide to ‘advertise’ the drink they got from the crustaceans, talking loudly about how great the drink and T’hau’s people are. Most everyone in the bar seems to respond well, except the crew of the Blind Sphinx. Stormbreaker eventually walks over to their table specifically, putting down what’s left of the bottle and inviting them to share in the drinks.
This sparks a conversation with captain Maximilian during which the crew none-too-subtly hints at their distaste at the behaviour of some of his crew. The captain in turn expresses his distaste for what he thinks is the crew’s lacklustre attempts at piracy. There’s some back and forth about strength, tensions rising slightly and seemingly coming to a head when the captain offers to pay for the damages of the Muddy Hut and very dismissively tosses T’hau a silver. 


============================







During the past few days at sea, T'hau is letting their mind go over the events and visions they encountered in the temple, with the three eyed creature. One night, T'hay dreams again.

T'hau finds themself at familiar cliff, staring down into the sea, feeling the call of the void. Then they look down and see feet, human feet, my own feet. They hear Etienne behind them calling their name, "Des". Waves come to a stand still. Turn around, see Etienne. Walk towards her, still standing still. Red glow coming down from the cliff. Put my hand on her cheek. Remember this cliff is in [[Brokenbank]]. 

Turn back to the red glow, see floating at cliff level the three eyed stranger they saw in the temple. Sourceless voice greets me as Desmond. Visions I saw there were not theirs, but of my own initiation. Creature says T'hau is unique in the sense that they have the ability to recall memories. None of the others of my kind seem to have this ability. Creature tells T'hau they are the creation of Ogrorlo, but then also confirms that Ogrorlo is no more, like we learned in the ruins in [[Natchuala Bay]]. 

Creature wants me to come back to them as the unique successful creation of Ogrorlo. In return, T'hau would be richly rewarded, that they would be returned to their former self, but also restore the other souls that make up T'hau's current existence. Creature says that if they want that, they should follow, and starts lowering themself back towards the sea.  T'hau asks if this dream is real and truly their memory, creature confirms. 

T'hau hesitates for a moment, but then turns back to Etienne, takes on final look and then blows her a kiss. Then, they let themself fall backwards off of the cliff while saying that they're sorry they have to do this. As they fall backwards, they see a reflection of a face in the water of a young dark-skinned man with brown eyes.

T'hau also reads the Tome of Understanding they found at the aboleth cult, learning about the aboleth and their ability to communicate as a hive mind. They start to understand more about their echo, dreams and memories, to the ability that they honed their senses to distinguish dreams and memories of their true self and others.

During the past few days at sea, T'hau is letting their mind go over the events and visions they encountered in the temple, with the three eyed creature. One night, T'hay dreams again.

T'hau finds themself at familiar cliff, staring down into the sea, feeling the call of the void. Then they look down and see feet, human feet, my own feet. They hear Etienne behind them calling their name, "Des". Waves come to a stand still. Turn around, see Etienne. Walk towards her, still standing still. Red glow coming down from the cliff. Put my hand on her cheek. Remember this cliff is in [[Brokenbank]]. 

Turn back to the red glow, see floating at cliff level the three eyed stranger they saw in the temple. Sourceless voice greets me as Desmond. Visions I saw there were not theirs, but of my own initiation. Creature says T'hau is unique in the sense that they have the ability to recall memories. None of the others of my kind seem to have this ability. Creature tells T'hau they are the creation of Ogrorlo, but then also confirms that Ogrorlo is no more, like we learned in the ruins in [[Natchuala Bay]]. 

Creature wants me to come back to them as the unique successful creation of Ogrorlo. In return, T'hau would be richly rewarded, that they would be returned to their former self, but also restore the other souls that make up T'hau's current existence. Creature says that if they want that, they should follow, and starts lowering themself back towards the sea.  T'hau asks if this dream is real and truly their memory, creature confirms. 

T'hau hesitates for a moment, but then turns back to Etienne, takes on final look and then blows her a kiss. Then, they let themself fall backwards off of the cliff while saying that they're sorry they have to do this. As they fall backwards, they see a reflection of a face in the water of a young dark-skinned man with brown eyes.

T'hau also reads the Tome of Understanding they found at the aboleth cult, learning about the aboleth and their ability to communicate as a hive mind. They start to understand more about their echo, dreams and memories, to the ability that they honed their senses to distinguish dreams and memories of their true self and others.

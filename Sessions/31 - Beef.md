[[T'hau]] speaks to [[Captain Entropy]], who asks about [[Nicodranas]]. He says he needs to get into Nicodranas, specifically the naval academy. T’hau says they went there as well, mentioning looking into some books. When asked, T’hau shares they were researching a civilization of aboleth, the Remnants of Salar. Entropy seems to recognize this instantly. He shares he was in Emon last month, looking for information on the same subject.

Entropy shares some more information, in exchange of a look at the books T’hau found and brought with them. Entropy lost his ship and his crew when Nicodranas got dragged into Hell. To survive, he was forced to make a deal, hence his tiefling looks. He learned that the aboleths have any form of knowledge one might desire - he hopes to find a ‘true name’ there, to get out of his devilish predicament. He’s looking for leverage on the creatures he made a deal with; he has defied them once before, but he doesn’t think he would survive another time.  

T’hau shares that in a way their goals are similar - like Entropy, they did not always look the way they do now, and they’re interested in finding a way back. 

In Emon, Entropy found out that a Captain Valeria on the Wild Rose was the one closest to finding out who the Remnants of Salar are. She taught at the naval academy, but this was a couple hundred years ago. She kept a precise log of what happened, some of her crew members also kept written logs. He’s interested in finding these logs. The researchers in Emon were apparently trying to replicate an item Valeria was rumored to have - a Thaumatic compass. Entropy helped fund their research into this. 

The compass is supposed to be sensitive towards telekenitic powers and will likely point to the location of the aboleths. 

Entropy says he’s already relieved that someone from the Serpent Tide’s crew knows to not torch the naval academy, glad to have someone on his side. He and T’hau share a drink before T’hau heads off to join the rest of the party at the Blind Sphinx. 

They catch T’hau up on the negotiations about Heddic. Both Storm and T’hau have similar ideas on how they can agree to what was discussed, but give it a little twist so it’s a lot less satisfying for Firetallon. The crew makes their way to Miss Margaret’s as they discuss this a little more.

They eventually agree to take the deal, but to see if Pock wants to join for this ‘public display / apology’ as well, hoping to trick Firetallon into apologizing to Pock in turn. T’hau goes to find Pock to suggest this plan to him as Lou runs out to run the plan by the captain as well. 

With Pock now having joined them, they head back to the Blind Sphinx to finalize the deal. As they board the Sphinx, T’hau, Doloris and Lou spot some of the crew putting hands on weapons. 

They address the captain, T’hau and Storm suggesting apologies are owed to Pock. Firetallon asks Wave on Shore to retrieve those of his crew who trashed the Muddy Hut. He returns with four tabaxi who look like they’ve been beaten, Firetallon telling them to apologize. He even puts a gun to one of their heads when their apologies aren’t loud enough. 

The deal is concluded, Firetallon immediately calling out orders for the ship to be made ready to sail out. Heddic is handed to them, Lou taking hold of his manacles and leading him off the ship. The others follow. 

After dropping Heddic off at the ship, the crew head to the Flotsam Court, where the captain was to be waiting for them. He’s not there, but the two other captains are. The ‘team dragon turtle’ captains are also there, sharing some of their plan on how they’re going to find the dragon turtle and then convince him. They also share Captain Cassian went on some two minutes ago, so the crew follow him into the tunnels.

The Plank Queen discusses the plan for entering Nicodranas. She is on good standing with some of the underwater folk in the area - the merfolk of Karakala spoke of a device that could make a ship invisible. The merfolk are currently around the southern gate reefs around Bwualli. Stormcaller Caelum Shoal leads this specific flock of merfolk; mentioning the Plank Queen should be enough to get them the conch. 

The mention of a conch makes Doloris ask if she knows this is really in the possession of the merfolk; she did overhear Firetallon and Gorehorn speak of a conch, the latter claiming to be in possession of one. 

This news upsets the Plank Queen, the throne of water she was on collapsing as she dives down. She searches through her things, looking for a crown of seaweed given to her by the merfolk, but it seems to be gone. She had a discussion with people from the Raging Torrent, Gorehorn’s ship, and them maybe going to Karakala, but she told them no. She doesn’t trust Gorehorn’s first mate. It seems like they took it and went there anyway. 

The Plank Queen seems most upset about potentially broken trust with the merfolk, asking the crew to retrieve both the crown as well as the conch from Gorehorn and his crew. She does warn them about the Raging Torrent’s first mate - she is a sea witch of sorts. Gorehorn is an idiot, but Shallowsoul, the first mate, is dangerous and intelligent. 
The crew rushes out to the docks, seeing Gorehorn’s ship having just left. Lou calls out to the Serpent Tide’s crew to ready the ship and everyone jumps into action.

They ready the ship and give chase, getting closer to the Raging Torrent right when they’re leaving the bay. They’re clearing the reef as the Serpent’s Tide gets their cannons within reach. They notice that all the sails aboard the Torrent are pulled up, then hear a low horn being blown. The water around the front of the Torrent starts to bubble, the ship then going below the water.

Doloris silences the sound of the horn as Rayna wildshapes into a giant seagull, flying over to the Torrent. 
Sea combat!

The crew quickly manages to take care of Shallow Soul, Rayna managing to take the conch away from her and bringing it to the captain. Combat continues, with most of the crew eventually managing to find their way across to the Torrent and taking on Gorehorn and what remains of his crew. They defeat him, seagull!Rayna getting the final blow as Doloris threatens the remaining crew into giving up. Lou spots the seawood crown in the captain’s quarters.

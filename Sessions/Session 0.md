The adventure begins in [[Darktow]], a town of pirates on the island of the same name, Darktow Isle. The island is run by a pirate organisation calling themselves [[The Revelry]]. Recently, construction finished on the first ship coming out of [[Darktow]]'s own shipyard, which has been called [[The Serpent's Tide]].

[[Captain Cassian Sariel de Rochefort|Captain Sariel]] and quartermaster [[Bartholomew Brittlestone]] are summoned to The Roost by the [[Plank Queen Yucalia]]. Yucalia briefs them on a new mission: intercept the prisoner transport of a [[Clovis Concord]] defector and free them. Afterwards, we should sail on to meet with [[Tamulia]] in [[Nicodranas]], and find a way to keep the port open for Revelry business.

The crew meet up on the upper floor of a tavern called the [[The Keel Hall]]. There, Captain Sariel lays down a map on the table and gives us the details on the mission. We'll hire some new crew here for the mission, Captain Sariel asks them to come forward. Eight individuals of various origins present themselves.

From those individuals, we select the following as our crew:
- A whale person woman called [[Big Neela]]
- A human woman called [[Julnar Norra]]
- A dwarven man and renowned Revelry pirate [[Odell Blackmoore]]
- A goblin man from Xorhas called [[Remmi Rattlebones]]

[[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] and [[T'hau]] are downstairs in the tavern, where a pair of halflings is playing music on top of a table, singing a jolly song. T'hau takes our their hand drum and joins in on the music, providing a jolly rhythm to the tune for the crowd to enjoy.

On the other side of the tavern, Rayna sits at a table playing Three Dragon Ante, where she's facing off an opponent in a duel. A large sum of money is already in the pot, a total of 26 gold is at stake. Rayna thinks she has a pretty good hand, and then against all odds, the dwarf bets all in. Looking at his face, Rayna spots a slight tell and thinks the dwarf is bluffing, so calls him on his bet. When the cards are thrown on the table, it shows that Rayna did have the better hand and hauls in the winnings. Quite the sore loser, the dwarf then challenges Rayna for a final bet, the winner takes double the pot, the loser gets a knife through their hand. Not taking the dwarf up on this bet, she politely thanks the dwarf in a sarcastic way and leaves the table to join the crew upstairs.

The following days, the crew prepare themselves for the journey ahead and load the ship with everything they need for the mission. Then [[The Serpent's Tide]] sets off on her maiden journey and sails out Darktow's port onto the Lucidian Ocean.

After a few days of travel, the crew find themselves near some isles to the north. A sudden screech is heard from the sky, as a mother griffon and four of her children attack the crew in search of a meal. The experienced crew quite easily takes care of the griffon

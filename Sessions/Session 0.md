The adventure begins in [[Darktow]], a town of pirates on the island of the same name, Darktow Isle. The island is run by a pirate organisation calling themselves [[The Revelry]]. Recently, construction finished on the first ship coming out of [[Darktow]]'s own shipyard, which has been called [[The Serpent's Tide]].

[[Captain Cassian Sariel de Rochefort|Captain Sariel]] and quartermaster [[Bartholomew Brittlestone]] are summoned to The Roost by the [[Plank Queen Yucalia]]. Yucalia briefs them on a new mission: intercept the prisoner transport of a [[Clovis Concord]] defector and free them. Afterwards, we should sail on to meet with [[Tamulia]] in [[Nicodranas]], and find a way to keep the port open for Revelry business.

The crew meet up in a tavern, called the [[The Keel Hall]]. There, Captain Sariel lays down a map on the table and gives us the details on the mission. We'll hire some new crew here for the mission, Captain Sariel asks them to come forward. Eight individuals of various origins present themselves.

From those individuals, we select the following as our crew:
- A whale person woman called [[Big Neela]]
- A human woman called [[Julnar Norra]]
- A dwarven man and renowned Revelry pirate [[Odell Blackmoore]]
- A goblin man from Xorhas called [[Remmi Rattlebones]]

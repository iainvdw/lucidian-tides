[[T'hau]], [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] and [[Doloris]] hoist up the sails to get the text out of view. Mal spots someone looking at us ducking behind a few barrels on the docks and sends [[Stormbreaker]] in to investigate.

Stormbreaker runs up to the barrels and grabs behind them, lifting up a kid by the collar of his clothing. It's one of the kids we saw earlier on the docks when we arrived in [[Nicodranas]]. The kid starts squirming and telling Stormbreaker he didn't see anything. As soon as Stormbreaker tells the kid he'll offer a gold coin for any valuable information, he hears two kids walk up behind him. He learns the kids' names, Squidly, Nat and Jenks. In exchange for some gold, the kids tell they saw a figure clad in dark clothing with an eye patch on the ship, but couldn't see a face.

As we are all gathered back on deck, Stormbreaker reports what he learned from the kids. Discussing how we want to deal with this public accusation, we plan to report [[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]]'s death to the [[Zhelezo]] to try and not raise suspicion.

Then [[Captain Cassian Sariel de Rochefort|Captain Sariel]] comes up top, and asks what happened when he sees the state of the ship. He says he hasn't heard anything as he was taking a quick nap, while Bartholomew was on watch. He agrees that reporting the murder and vandalism might be best indeed. Captain will report this himself and make a tour round the docks to talk to the fishermen, to see if they saw anything.

When [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] is done taking down the sail, she finds [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] and proposes to burn the sail somewhere out of sight. The rest of the crew think a fire that large might attract unwanted attention. Instead, [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] and [[T'hau]] hide the sail underwater on the edge of the harbour area and secure it down with a heavy rock.

Meanwhile, [[Stormbreaker]] checks in on [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]]. She says [[Bartholomew]] didn’t deserve this. Stormbreaker assures her it’s okay to be upset. They talk about how there’s now a target on this ship, how this was a message. They agree to give Bartholomew a proper burial. Doloris has meanwhile gathered some cloth and tar to try and find whatever they might need to help arrange this proper funeral. 

Zhelezo comes on deck to assess the situation, asks what happened, if anyone was witness to this. Zhelezo officer by the name of Levinia starts asking everybody questions, another taking notes of our answers and the scene. Levinia tells us they have seen similar scenes like this, a message from The Myriad. Ship and captain needs to stay in the Restless Wharf during the investigation, so we need to find another ship to sail out to Natchualla Bay.

Doloris stays up all night to take care of Bartholomew's body, trying to mend it to a better state for his funeral. The rest gets a night's rest. The following morning Doloris is finishing up her work on Bartholomew's body, making his wounds seem hardly recognisable anymore. We find his bucket list, and tick off the final few boxes:

- Teach a few intrepid youngsters
- Become a pirate again
- Go on an adventure
- See Belinda again

The almost completed bucket list will be sent off with his body when we do a burial at sea.

Rayna leads a few of us around the docks, looking for another ship. There's two fishing crew squabbling amongst each other for a fishing spot. There's also a seemingly drunken man in a large sloop with a sail, called The Hydra. Rayna asks if we can borrow the ship to clear the fishing spot that's been bothering the fishermen. Man will be at the Low Lantern.

A few hours later, we have prepared ourselves for the journey out into Natchualla Bay. We sail out and find the spot in the bay. The bay is flanked by the cliffs of The Menagie Coast, a main pillar stands out from the water. There's large patches of coral below us. We don't spot any bones from the surface, so Mal and T'hau dive into the water to do some further scouting.

As soon as we dive into the water, T'hau notices that in the largest coral reef a bit further up, there's a cave in the cliffs. There's also a crevasse that plunges into the depths. A large anemone. There's also a few graves, mounds of dirt with remembrances on them, a few bones sticking out. We swim over to investigate, many different types of bones. One has been dug up, but we have no idea how or what has done that. Underwater graves for sea dwelling folks are fairly common. We are fairly close to Karrakala, a city of merfolk. But there's more bones and corpses, even on K'thaumi. Seems odd to T'hau that there's more K'thaumi this far out, but doesn't recognize the corpse.

Mal finds that the dug up grave has been recently dug up by webbed humanoid hands. Previous graves have been dug up and smoothed over.

Mal spots a symbol scratched into the walls of the crevasse:

![[Pasted image 20230426212450.png]]

As she points out the symbol to T'hau, when they look at it, something takes a hold of them and starts thrashing about.

On the surface, a knock can be heard on the back of the ship. The crew look around and see two merfolk addressing them, asking if we're here to investigate the bones. Two are from Karrakala and are glad to hear that we're investigating. The merfolk tell the crew that bones erupted out from the ocean, freaked them out and the female merfolk lost her necklace. The crew tell that Mal and T'hau

T'hau has seen this symbol before, back from the place where they were enslaved, panicking heavily. Remember it as Remnant of Salar.

Merfolk swim over to us, introduce themselves as Talnad and Valas. T'hau tells them about the symbol they saw, merfolk tell they call it the Symbol of Ogrorlo. Ogrorlo used to be a creature that enslaved a lot of folks around this place. Ogrorlo apparently died a while ago, since then this place became a nice spot to hunt. Merfolk ask us if we're investigating the bones. Bones floated up one day, scaring the female merfolk and cause her to lose her necklace into the gorge. Asks us if we're going to investigate.

T'hau swims over to the gorge and peers over the edge, to look into

Flashback:

> You are out of breath. You've ran as hard as you could. A laugh still feelable in your cheeks. Your dark skinned bare feet stop your forward momentum at the edge of a cliff. 
> 
> Jungle vines and palmtrees around you as a few loose rocks crumble off and tumble down. 
> 
> You stare into the choppy waves, dozens of feet below you, slapping themselves against the rock.
> 
> The smile vanishes. And you get this feeling that all mortals are familiar with: the call of the void. "What if, i'd jump". It's this strange sensation where you are suddenly left pondering your own mortality. 
> 
> But it's deeper than that. A pit forms in your stomach as you see the deep blue waters below you. Somehow knowing that your are doomed to sink to their depths one day. 
> 
> In the distance a seagull is cawing.
> 
> You are shaken out of your moment by two hands grabbing you at the shoulders and saying "Got you!". As the hands direct you to turn around, you stare into a bright smiling face. Freckles peeking through her mocca-colored skin. A big mop of curly black hair trailing her. 
> 
> The seagull continues to caw.
> 
> Her brown eyes turning a glowing amber in the trailing light of the sun. The pit in your stomach melts away as you see her smile... And all she says is "are you okay Dez? I... i didn't mean to scare you... I'm sorry"
> 
> She looks worried, taking your hands and directing you away from the ledge. 
> 
> Then the seagull's screeches turn into screams of your name: "T'hau! T'hau!". 

Mal sees T'hau dive, stare at the gorge and dive down into the hole. Mal rushes down, grabs them by the ankle and pulls them back up. T'hau snaps out of it as Mal shouts their name and then starts wondering what happened, trying hard to remember the flashback they had just now.

As Mal gets T'hau to their senses, she suggests going back to the ship and discuss next steps for this place. Just about as they were to head back, the female merfolk suddenly turns on us and casts a spell as a thunderous wave blasts through the water.

A fight ensues, we defeat the merfolk.

Mal, Stormbreaker and T'hau swim back to the rest. Back on the ship, T'hau and Mal explain what just happened. T'hau tells them about the symbol and their history of mental enslavement.

Both merfolk have a burn mark on the inside of their wrists, almost elven symbol. Symbol in Karrala for thieves, making a living out of conning people.

We dive down into the gorge, it goes down 1500ft. Feel pressure building up as we dive down. Completely dark. Scratchings all over the side of the walls, looking similar to the earlier symbol, looking like some kind of words. None of us recognise the language.

Rayna notices a faintly glowing green symbol and asks T'hau to go there. As I lay my hand on the symbol, I can hear a faintly whispering voice telling to "Bend the knee, pearl. The god Ogrorlo, the shield and our protector, rests here"

Hieroglyphics carved into the side of a stone chest at the bottom. 

T'hau opens the chest and finds white pearls, larger pink pearls, single large black pearl. Trident. Figurine of coral.

Doloris picks up the black pearl, swims up to the symbol T'hau touched, and gets a vision of a city of aboleths. Two creatures with rows of red eyes swim up to Doloris' vision and she pulls back as her heads starts hurting. Doloris relays this to all of us. Doesn't fully ring a bell with T'hau.

Trident is made of adamantium, +1 trident. Pearls are worth 2000gp. Mal finds that the figurine is a figurine of wondrous power, containing a hunter shark that can be summoned from it.

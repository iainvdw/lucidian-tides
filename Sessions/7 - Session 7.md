We get on the ship, find Bartholomew's entrails and "Pirate scrum" written on the sails. Mal, T'hau and Doloris hoist the sails up to get the text out of view. Mal spots a head ducking behind a few barrels and sends Stormbreak in.

Stormbreaker runs up to the barrels and grabs behind it, lifting up a kid by the neck. Kid starts squirming and telling Stormbreaker he didn't see anything. Three kids walk up behind Stormbreaker. Kids saw a figure clad in dark clothing, eye patch.

We discuss our next steps, we plan to report Bartholomew's death to the Zhelezo.

We get on the ship, find Bartholomew's entrails and "Pirate scrum" written on the sails. Mal, T'hau and Doloris hoist the sails up to get the text out of view. Mal spots a head ducking behind a few barrels and sends Stormbreak in.

Stormbreaker runs up to the barrels and grabs behind it, lifting up a kid by the neck. Kid starts squirming and telling Stormbreaker he didn't see anything. Three kids walk up behind Stormbreaker. Kids saw a figure clad in dark clothing, eye patch.

We discuss our next steps, we plan to report Bartholomew's death to the Zhelezo to make ourselves not suspicious.

Captain comes up top, sees the state of the ship, asks what happened. Says he hasn't heard anything as he was taking a quick nap. Agrees that reporting might be best. Captain will report himself and make a tour round the docks to talk to the fishermen.

Mal and Rayna propose to burn the sail somewhere out of sight, but that might attract attention. Mal and T'hau hide the sail underwater in the harbour area and secure it down with a heavy rock.

Stormbreaker finds Rayna on deck, who's staring out over the sea, asking herself if she shouldn't feel upset. Rayna says that Bartholomew didn't deserve this.

Zhelezo comes on deck to assess the situation, asks what happened, if anyone was witness to this. Zhelezo officer by the name of Levinia starts asking everybody questions, another taking notes of our answers and the scene. Levinia tells us they have seen similar scenes like this, a message from The Myriad. Ship and captain needs to stay in the Restless Wharf during the investigation, so we need to find another ship to sail out to Natchualla Bay.

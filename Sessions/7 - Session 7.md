[[T'hau]], [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] and [[Doloris]] hoist up the sails to get the text out of view. Mal spots someone looking at us ducking behind a few barrels on the docks and sends [[Stormbreaker]] in to investigate.

Stormbreaker runs up to the barrels and grabs behind them, lifting up a kid by the collar of his clothing. It's one of the kids we saw earlier on the docks when we arrived in [[Nicodranas]]. The kid starts squirming and telling Stormbreaker he didn't see anything. As soon as Stormbreaker tells the kid he'll offer a gold coin for any valuable information, he hears two kids walk up behind him. He learns the kids' names, Squidly, Nat and Jenks. In exchange for some gold, the kids tell they saw a figure clad in dark clothing with an eye patch on the ship, but couldn't see a face.

As we are all gathered back on deck, Stormbreaker reports what he learned from the kids. Discussing how we want to deal with this public accusation, we plan to report [[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]]'s death to the [[Zhelezo]] to try and not raise suspicion.

Then [[Captain Cassian Sariel de Rochefort|Captain Sariel]] comes up top, and asks what happened when he sees the state of the ship. He says he hasn't heard anything as he was taking a quick nap, while Bartholomew was on watch. He agrees that reporting the murder and vandalism might be best indeed. Captain will report this himself and make a tour round the docks to talk to the fishermen, to see if they saw anything.

When [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] is done taking down the sail, she finds [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] and proposes to burn the sail somewhere out of sight. The rest of the crew think a fire that large might attract unwanted attention. Instead, [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] and [[T'hau]] hide the sail underwater on the edge of the harbour area and secure it down with a heavy rock.

Meanwhile, [[Stormbreaker]] checks in on [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]]. She says [[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]] didn’t deserve this. Stormbreaker assures her it’s okay to be upset. They talk about how there’s now a target on this ship, how this was a message. They agree to give Bartholomew a proper burial. [[Doloris]] has meanwhile gathered some cloth and tar to try and find whatever they might need to help arrange this proper funeral. 

Some [[Zhelezo]] come on deck with the captain to assess the situation, and start asking questions. A Zhelezo officer by the name of captain Lavinia introduces herself and starts asking everybody questions, with another Zhelezo taking notes of our answers and the scene. Levinia tells us they have seen similar scenes like this, seemingly a message from [[Myriad|The Myriad]]. Ship and captain need to stay in the Restless Wharf for a few days during the investigation, so we need to find another ship to sail out to [[Natchuala Bay]].

[[Doloris]] offers to take care of [[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]]'s body during the night, to try and mend it to a better state for his funeral. The rest of the crew tries to gets some rest in the wake of today's events. 

The following morning Doloris is finishing up her work on Bartholomew's body, making his wounds seem hardly recognisable anymore. The crew remembers Bartholomew had a bucket list and search his cabin to find it. On it they find a few final items that are left unticked:

- Teach a few intrepid youngsters
- Become a pirate again
- Go on an adventure
- See Belinda again

We tick these final items for him and decide to send his bucket list off with his body when we do the burial at sea.

[[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] leads a few of us around the docks, looking for another ship we can use to get to [[Natchuala Bay]]. There's two fishing crew squabbling on the docks over a fishing spot. There's also a seemingly drunken man in a large sloop with one sail, called The Hydra. Rayna asks if we can borrow the ship to clear the fishing spot that's been bothering the fishermen. The man agrees to let us borrow his ship, after some convincing. He mentions we can find him later at the Low Lantern inn.

A few hours later, we have prepared ourselves for the journey out into [[Natchuala Bay]]. We sail out for a few hours the bay, which is flanked by the cliffs of The Menagerie Coast. A main rocky pillar stands out from the water. Through the clear water, we see large patches of coral below us. We don't directly spot any bones from the surface, so [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] and [[T'hau]] dive into the water to do some scouting.

In the water, [[T'hau]] notices that that in the largest part of the coral reef a bit further up, there's a cave in the cliffs. A large anemone sits next to a crevasse that plunges deep into the depths. A few sea graves line the edge of the crevasse, mounds of dirt with remembrances on them, and a few bones sticking out. We swim over to investigate, and see many different types of bones. One grave has been dug up, but we find no clues who or what has done that. We know that underwater graves for sea dwelling folks are fairly common and we are fairly close to Karrakala, a nation of merfolk, so we link the two together. Inspecting the graves a bit closes, we can see a variety of remnants, even one K'thaumi. T'hau starts wondering about how far out this corpse is, compared to where they came from.

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] finds that the dug up grave has been recently dug up by webbed humanoid hands. Other graves have been dug up previously and smoothed over again.

Mal spots a symbol scratched into the walls of the crevasse, and points it out to [[T'hau]]:

![[Pasted image 20230426212450.png]]

As T'hau looks over at the symbol, they start panicking immediately at the sight of this symbol, thrashing about in the water.

Back in the sloop, [[Stormbreaker]], [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] and [[Doloris]] hear a knock on the back of the sloop. They look over and see a female and male merfolk addressing them, asking if we're here to investigate the bones. The woman introduces herself as Talnad, and the man as Valas. They say they are from Karakala and are glad to hear that we're investigating. The merfolk tell the crew that some time ago, bones suddenly erupted out from the ocean floor, and freaked them out. Talnad says she lost her necklace and asks if we like to help retrieve it. The crew mention that [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] and [[T'hau]] are already in the water, investigating the bay.

Back under water, [[T'hau]] calms down just enough to tell [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] he has seen this symbol before. Telling [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] they escaped from place where they were mentally enslaved by some creature. The phrase 'Remnant of Salar' comes to mind when they think about it. Their memory is muddled and vague, but T'hau does remember this symbol.

The merfolk swim over to Mal and T'hau and also introduce themselves to them. T'hau tells them about the symbol in the crevasse, and the merfolk tell they call it the Symbol of Ogrorlo. Ogrorlo apparently used to be a creature that enslaved a lot of folks around this place, seemingly in a similar way to T'hau. It has been a while since Ogrorlo apparently died, and since then this place became a nice spot to hunt. The merfolk ask if we're here to investigate the floating bones, and tell us that the bones floated up one day when they were hunting, scaring Talnad and causing her to lose her necklace into the crevasse. She asks if we would like to help her retrieve it. 

[[T'hau]] overcomes their panic a bit and carefully swims over to the gorge to peer down into it, but as they do, there's a sudden flashback:

> You are out of breath. You've ran as hard as you could. A laugh can still be felt in your cheeks. Your dark skinned bare feet stop your forward momentum just at the edge of a cliff. 
> 
> Jungle vines and palm trees stretch out around you as you see a few loose rocks crumble off and tumble down the cliffside into the sea.
> 
> You stare into the choppy waves, dozens of feet below you, slapping themselves against the rock.
> 
> The smile vanishes and you get this feeling that all mortals are familiar with: the call of the void. "What if I'd jump". It's this strange sensation where you are suddenly left pondering over your own mortality. 
> 
> But it turns to a feeling deeper than that. A pit forms in your stomach as you see the deep blue waters below you, somehow knowing that your are doomed to sink to their depths one day. 
> 
> In the distance a seagull is heard cawing.
> 
> You are shaken out of your moment by two hands grabbing you at the shoulders and saying "Got you!". As the hands direct you to turn around, you stare into a bright smiling face. Freckles peeking through her mocha-coloured skin. A big mop of curly black hair trailing her. 
> 
> The seagull continues to caw.
> 
> Her brown eyes turn a glowing amber in the trailing light of the sun. The pit in your stomach melts away as you see her smile... And all she says is "Are you okay Dez? I... I didn't mean to scare you... I'm sorry..."
> 
> She looks worried, taking your hands and directing you away from the ledge. 
> 
> Then the seagull's screeches turn into screams of your own name: "T'hau! T'hau!". 

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] sees [[T'hau]] hover over the gorge, staring down and then suddenly dive down into the hole. Mal feels something is amiss and rushes down, grabbing them by the ankle and pulls them back up. T'hau snaps out of it as Mal shouts their name and then starts wondering what happened, trying hard to remember the flashback they had just now.

As Mal gets T'hau to their senses, she suggests going back to the ship and discuss next steps for this place. Just about as they were turning to head back, Talnad suddenly turns on them, when they cast a spell and a thunderous wave blasts through the water towards them.

A fight ensues between the crew and the merfolk. [[Stormbreaker]] dives into the water to help out. Valas gives out a scream underwater as he calls for aid from a scavver fish swimming up from the gorge and swallows [[T'hau]] whole. [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] and [[Doloris]] notice this happening from the sloop, and fires a few fires bolts into the water, causing the scavver to regurgitate T'hau again. We manage to defeat the merfolk after a short fight and reconvene back on the sloop.

T'hau tells the crew about the symbol they saw and what it means, revealing their past of enslavement. Doloris recalls the name Ogrorlo, telling it's a creature that preyed on fishermen, merfolk and other people, enslaving them. She also knows the creature to be an aboleth.

The crew discuss investigating the crevasse for a short moment and they all decide to go as [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] casts spells to form air bubbles around the crew that can't breathe under water, and transforms into a crab herself, latching onto [[T'hau]]'s shoulder.

Investigating the merfolk, we find they have a burn mark on the inside of their wrists, an almost elven symbol. Mal recognises this symbol as Karakalan for thieves and outcasts, indicating that these merfolk we making a living out of conning people.

We dive down into the gorge, and it goes down for a long while, around 1500ft. Feel pressure building up as we dive down. Completely dark. Scratchings all over the side of the walls, looking similar to the earlier symbol, looking like some kind of words. None of us recognise the language.

Rayna notices a faintly glowing green symbol and asks T'hau to go there. As I lay my hand on the symbol, I can hear a faintly whispering voice telling to "Bend the knee, pearl. The god Ogrorlo, the shield and our protector, rests here"

Hieroglyphics carved into the side of a stone chest at the bottom. 

T'hau opens the chest and finds white pearls, larger pink pearls, single large black pearl. Trident. Figurine of coral.

Doloris picks up the black pearl, swims up to the symbol T'hau touched, and gets a vision of a city of aboleths. Two creatures with rows of red eyes swim up to Doloris' vision and she pulls back as her heads starts hurting. Doloris relays this to all of us. Doesn't fully ring a bell with T'hau.

Trident is made of adamantium, +1 trident. Pearls are worth 2000gp. Mal finds that the figurine is a figurine of wondrous power, containing a hunter shark that can be summoned from it.

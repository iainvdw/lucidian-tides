We get on the ship, find Bartholomew's entrails and "Pirate scrum" written on the sails. Mal, T'hau and Doloris hoist the sails up to get the text out of view. Mal spots a head ducking behind a few barrels and sends Stormbreak in.

Stormbreaker runs up to the barrels and grabs behind it, lifting up a kid by the neck. Kid starts squirming and telling Stormbreaker he didn't see anything. Three kids walk up behind Stormbreaker. Kids saw a figure clad in dark clothing, eye patch.

We discuss our next steps, we plan to report Bartholomew's death to the Zhelezo to make ourselves not suspicious.

Captain comes up top, sees the state of the ship, asks what happened. Says he hasn't heard anything as he was taking a quick nap. Agrees that reporting might be best. Captain will report himself and make a tour round the docks to talk to the fishermen.

Mal and Rayna propose to burn the sail somewhere out of sight, but that might attract attention. Mal and T'hau hide the sail underwater in the harbour area and secure it down with a heavy rock.

Stormbreaker finds Rayna on deck, who's staring out over the sea, asking herself if she shouldn't feel upset. Rayna says that Bartholomew didn't deserve this.

Zhelezo comes on deck to assess the situation, asks what happened, if anyone was witness to this. Zhelezo officer by the name of Levinia starts asking everybody questions, another taking notes of our answers and the scene. Levinia tells us they have seen similar scenes like this, a message from The Myriad. Ship and captain needs to stay in the Restless Wharf during the investigation, so we need to find another ship to sail out to Natchualla Bay.

Doloris stays up all night to take care of Bartholomew's body, trying to mend it to a better state for his funeral. The rest gets a night's rest. The following morning Doloris is finishing up her work on Bartholomew's body, making his wounds seem hardly recognisable anymore. We find his bucket list, and tick off the final few boxes:

- Teach a few intrepid youngsters
- Become a pirate again
- Go on an adventure
- See Belinda again

The almost completed bucket list will be sent off with his body when we do a burial at sea.

Rayna leads a few of us around the docks, looking for another ship. There's two fishing crew squabbling amongst each other for a fishing spot. There's also a seemingly drunken man in a large sloop with a sail, called The Hydra. Rayna asks if we can borrow the ship to clear the fishing spot that's been bothering the fishermen. Man will be at the Low Lantern.

A few hours later, we have prepared ourselves for the journey out into Natchualla Bay. We sail out and find the spot in the bay. The bay is flanked by the cliffs of The Menagie Coast, a main pillar stands out from the water. There's large patches of coral below us. We don't spot any bones from the surface, so Mal and T'hau dive into the water to do some further scouting.

As soon as we dive into the water, T'hau notices that in the largest coral reef a bit further up, there's a cave in the cliffs. There's also a crevasse that plunges into the depths. A large anemone. There's also a few graves, mounds of dirt with remembrances on them, a few bones sticking out. We swim over to investigate, many different types of bones. One has been dug up, but we have no idea how or what has done that. Underwater graves for sea dwelling folks are fairly common. We are fairly close to Karrakala, a city of merfolk. But there's more bones and corpses, even on K'thaumi. Seems odd to T'hau that there's more K'thaumi this far out, but doesn't recognize the corpse.

Mal finds that the dug up grave has been recently dug up by webbed humanoid hands. Previous graves have been dug up and smoothed over.

Mal spots a symbol scratched into the walls of the crevasse:

As she points out the symbol to T'hau, when they look at it, something takes a hold of them and starts thrashing about.

On the surface, a knock can be heard on the back of the ship. The crew look around and see two merfolk addressing them, asking if we're here to investigate the bones. Two are from Karrakala and are glad to hear that we're investigating. The merfolk tell the crew that bones erupted out from the ocean, freaked them out and the female merfolk lost her necklace. The crew tell that Mal and T'hau

T'hau has seen this symbol before, back from the place where they were enslaved, panicking heavily. Remember it as Remnant of Salar.

Merfolk swim over to us, introduce themselves as Talnad and Valas. T'hau tells them about the symbol they saw, merfolk tell they call it the Symbol of Ogrorlo. Ogrorlo used to be a creature that enslaved a lot of folks around this place. Ogrorlo apparently died a while ago, since then this place became a nice spot to hunt. Merfolk ask us if we're investigating the bones. Bones floated up one day, scaring the female merfolk and cause her to lose her necklace into the gorge. Asks us if we're going to investigate.

T'hau swims over to the gorge and peers over the edge, to look into

Flashback:

> Des / Dez?

Mal sees T'hau dive, stare at the gorge and dive down into the hole. Mal rushes down, grabs them by the ankle and pulls them back up. T'hau snaps out of it and starts wondering what happened, vaguely remembering.

As Mal gets T'hau to their senses, she suggests going back to the ship and discuss next steps. Just about as they were to head back, the female merfolk casts a spell and a thunderous wave blasts through the water, turning on us.

A fight ensues, we defeat the merfolk.

Back on the ship, T'hau and Mal explain what happened. T'hau tells them about the symbol.

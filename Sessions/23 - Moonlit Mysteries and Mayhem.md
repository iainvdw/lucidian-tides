They cross the seabed, picking up on eerie sounds all around them. A large shadow swims past them. [[T'hau|T’hau]] pokes their head into the water, trying to get a closer look at what kind of creature this is, but they don’t recognise it. They rush along the path as fast as they can.

They reach the other side and as they look back, some of the group note a scaled creature in the water, some hundred feet away from them. It seems to be a dragon. [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] deduces this is likely Omgar, the dragon this island and area is named after. 

The compass points them further into the woods. Before they proceed, [[Mudgraw]] suggests dividing up some tasks. [[Stormbreaker]] takes the lead on chopping some of the heavier foliage in their way, [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] keeping an eye out as [[Doloris]] and Mal do their best to navigate. 
After about an hour, Rayna spots a now familiar glow, similar to the glowing astrolabe they found. The compass also points towards this.

As they get closer, they spot a single petal of a flower underneath a beam of moonlight. It glows with a soft ethereal light. The compass points towards the flower now. T’hau pokes at the flower, as it moves more into the beam of light, the flower opens up. The heart of the flower pulses with a radiance. The flower unfurls, its petals animating around it. T’hau shakes of a mesmerizing effect of the flower. 

Rayna hears something from behind her, but doesn’t see anything. 
The scent of the flower hits Mal and Doloris as well. Mal watches as the map changes, the compass now pointing in another direction, but Doloris seems overcome by the beauty of the flower. She suddenly feels overcome with a need to protect this flower, to the death. 

Mal suggests they keep going, but Doloris finds she can’t leave. They discuss what to do with the flower, Mal figuring out that pulling it into the shadow might close the petals again and get rid of the scent that seems to be intoxicating Doloris. Pushing the petals out of the shadows doesn’t necessarily seem to work. At Doloris’ insistence, Mal smacks her, but that doesn’t snap her out of it either.

As this happens, they see lights up in the sky, which hypnotises both Stormbreaker and [[Mudgraw]]. Some yuan-ti seem to have snuck on them.

Combat. 

The yuan-ti seemed to be looking for the map, but the crew defeats them. 
Doloris finds she still can’t move away from the flower. She asks the others to look for a dagger, but they don’t find anything. She casts Lesser Restoration on herself, which snaps her out of it. She also takes a look at the yuan-ti, but can’t find the kris knife she’s looking for either. 

With the flower outside of the moonlight, the map seems to have gone dormant. T’hau moves their echo near the flower to move it back into the moonlight. The map in the echo’s hands comes to life again. 

They continue following the map. Eventually reach a river with a cliff across, which is where the compass is pointing. They swim and talk their way across the river. At the cliff face, they find Elvish writing on the wall. Doloris takes an educated guess as to what it says, based on her Elvish lessons with [[Captain Cassian Sariel de Rochefort|the captain]]. 

She speaks the words and clouds start to move in, obstructing the moonlight. The compass now points to the east, shifting after the words were spoken. 
They follow the compass again, along the cliff face. The compass is their only light, everything around them is shrouded in darkness. Mal pulls out her rope, everyone holding on to it as they start moving forward. 

Rayna feels something tug at her leg, alerting the others to it. Mal tells her to kick at it, which she does, which momentarily seems to get rid of it until Rayna feels a chill run down her spine. Their voices echo around them, more hands then grabbing at Rayna. They try to keep going quietly, continuing in silence through the absolute darkness. 

Eventually, the clouds begin to part and they can see moonlight again, the complete darkness gone. They are no longer in a valley. The river has bent off away from where they are, the cliff wall is still there, running into the jungle. The foliage is creeping up a hill, which is where the compass is currently pointing. 

Rayna spots an open area in the forest, as well as more moonlight-reflecting things up ahead. She can hear screams coming from there. It sounds like people calling for help. 
They take a moment to rest up before moving on, climbing up the hill. There’s a clearing at the top of the hill, which is where both the glow as well as the screams are coming from. 

The clearing is marked with a circle of stone arches with interlocking circular walkways. Part of the structure has collapsed. Mal spots two creatures sitting in the center of the circle. They are tied back to back, look like two young yuan-ti purebloods, they are the ones screaming for help. Mal also notes the holy symbol that the woman is wearing, a holy symbol of Avandra. 

T’hau scouts ahead through his echo. As the echo comes closer, it spots more Elvish writing, some of which is illuminated by the moonlight, some isn’t. It spots a talisman around the man’s neck, the symbol of the Wildmother.

T’hau has their echo walk into plain sight next, trying to see if this triggers any kind of ambush. The woman instantly responds to seeing the echo, asking if they can be freed, warning them that ‘they’ will be coming back.

Nesali explains they were captured by the Grung, a small group of frog folk. The man’s name is Zihu. The Grung belief she and Zihu have something to do with the illumination of this place. She says she and Zihu fled from the Fane of the Cloaked Serpent, mentioning Astus the Misshapen and Talesh the Pronounced. They do not want to be found by the other yuan-ti.  

The crew heads down, Mal casting Comprehend Languages so she can try and start reading the Elvish writing on the ground here. 

>In the night's embrace, Avandra's tender glow,
>Whispers secrets where the silent waters flow.
>Mirror its light where the shadows dance,
>To unveil the hidden, in a silvery glance.

The others free the two yuan-ti, who tell them where the Grung disappeared to and they’re likely to be back soon. Nesali and Zihu aren’t too familiar with the area, they at least weren’t aware of the Grung living in this area. 

Nesali runs into the tree line, Doloris following her there. She seems to want to get out of here. She asks Doloris if Avandra guided her here, Doloris saying it was the Wildmother instead. Nesali speaks of yuan-ti like her, some of which are made. She knows little of her previous life. She and Zihu both started hearing the voices of their respective gods, telling them to get away and to come here. They’ve been trying to figure out this place, but neither of them know the script.

When Doloris asks, Nesali says she’s never heard of the Briarblaze Heart. Doloris asks if any of the story surrounding it is familiar to Nesali, to which she says she’s heard someone called Astus speak of it. Doloris doesn’t believe it’s a coincidence the two of them were called here, saying they should consider sticking with the crew. Nelasi also shares that the blade Doloris is looking for is wielded by Talesh the Pronounced.

Mal shares the writings with Rayna, pointing her to where she thinks they need to be and asking her to cast some light there. Rayna’s fire illuminates some of the script there. As she looks up, she sees her flame reflected in orb-like eyes in the trees.

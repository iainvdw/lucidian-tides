The next morning, the crew sets out towards the Lavish Chateau. The Opal Archways are clearly the wealthy part of town. Fencing has been placed around the building, which is partially collapsed. Two [[Zhelezo]] stand next to the building. They start looking for a subtle way inside. 

They find a place in the fence that they can slip through. Mal talks to the guards as a distraction, leaving the others the opportunity to sneak in. They come out onto a decrepit looking deck with two large windows, though there’s no glass left in the windows. 
Mal ‘follows’ the guards’ instructions on how to get to the [[Guillaume de Montfort|de Montfort]] estate, circling around to make it back to the others.

The others find a way into the Lavish Chateau, noting some things like keys have been stolen, perhaps because they were made of valuable materials. There’s a foul smell, T’hau commenting on it as it reminds him of the smell in the other house they were in, where they found some devilish remnants. They talk about keeping quiet as much as possible and waiting for Mal to arrive, as none of them really know a lot about devils. 

Mal joins the others and they start looking around. She tries to pick up on any signs of recent fiendish activity. There’s something in the room up ahead, a dripping sound. She also sees, melted into the floor, something shiny, not fiendish, but other planar. She also senses some seven fiendish presences nearby. 

She points this out to the others. Doloris looks at the shiny object: it looks like a molten holy symbol, a large coin. Part of a female face is still on there, Doloris recognises it as Avandra. She goes to pick it up, but is hit with a psychic blast of all this item has seen. The visions she sees remind her of Avernus. She sees figures in the room, moving through the room they’re in. 

They decide to follow the visions Doloris saw, heading up the creaky stairs. They look through some of the rooms, not finding much at first. Doloris eventually finds a glowing ember in one of the rooms, Mal picking up on a lingering fiendish presence in the other room.

Mal and T’hau investigate the presence. T’hau notices some footsteps in the dust in this room that lead up to the bath. T’hau and Mal thoroughly investigate the bathtub, which seems suspicious.

Stormbreaker and Rayna continue investigating in the other direction. There’s a gap in the ceiling, there’s a lot of bird droppings in this area despite the ceiling not being open. Rayna thinks these are parrot droppings. 

Doloris presses a hand to the wall on the other side, which changes the reflection that T’hau and Mal see in the water of the bath tub. T’hau recalls the dwarven henchmen of [[Kirour Grimblade|Kirour]] who had a ring, which he thinks might help with this. The ring was tied to the fiendish parrot, and the dwarf made a pact whilst in Avernus. He asks Doloris if she still has the ring on her, which she confirms. 

She brings the ring over, the water shimmers instantly. The reflection now shows a cavernous ceiling of jet black stone. There’s reflections of green and purple flames and Doloris instantly knows this place from her dreams. They try to figure out what this thing is. T’hau throws a stone into the water. 

Stormbreaker and Rayna continue further into the building, finding themselves in front of a locked door. Stormbreaker ‘unlocks’ the door. It opens up into a completely cleared room, with no windows to the outside. There’s a lectern with parchment on it, along with ink and a fountain pen, all of it looking very clean compared to the rest of the place. It smells like brimstone. 

The parchment is empty. There’s some parchment wax there as well. There are some grooves in the paper, which could possibly show them what was written on the previous paper. 

T’hau reaches out to Stormbreaker and Rayna to ask them to come over. The two groups catch each other up. Rayna sticks her hand into the bath tub water. The water is strangely warm. She can almost feel the water inching into her mind. 
Rayna ritually casts detect magic as Mal looks at the paper that Stormbreaker and Rayna found, finding out what was written on the paper above. Not everything is clear, but three sets of signatures appear at the bottom. The first says D. [[Commander Da'urlo Vidorant|Vidorant]], the second G. de Montfort and the third by H. Ribbond. Some more details of the letter tell Mal that her father brokered the ‘peace’ between the Myriad and the Golden Chain. The contract is dated a month a half ago. 

Meanwhile, Stormbreaker checks out some more of the Lavish Chateau. He finds himself to the top room, finding a big black mushy puddle in the middle of it. Almost looks like a bunch of corpses that were melted together. As he’s looking at this, there’s a loud noise as a window flies open. He sees the spirit of a female halfling hanging in front of the window. Stormbreaker calls out to Doloris, who comes over as well. 
It looks like a young halfling woman, her throat seems to have been slit. She’s trying to say something. 

In the other room, Rayna’s detect magic picks up on conjuration magic on the water in the bathtub. She thinks draining the bathtub would likely already do the trick. The water seems to be from the River Styx. 
Rayna asks Mal to make sure that touching it didn’t do anything to her, Mal assures her she seems fine. As the two of them talk about how to get rid of the water, Rayna, as well as Stormbreaker in the other room, hear the floorboards creaking below them. They hear voices. 

Doloris sees a young woman and a young man enter the chateau. They head upstairs, towards where Rayna and Mal are. The door bursts open. It’s Mal’s sister, Lucienne, and her betrothed, Eliander. Lucienne and Mal speak, Stormbreaker and Doloris sneaking up on the conversation behind them. 

Lucienne says she is here for business, showing Mal a ring similar to the one they found on the dwarf. She asks the group to stand aside, Rayna saying they’ll gladly do so before casting Thunderwave on the bathtub, the water going everywhere. Some of the water hits T’hau, leaving him confused on where he is.

Mal attempts to tell her sister she’s outnumbered, but her sister doesn’t seem worried, instead turning into a devilish form. Eliander casts a fireball onto some of the group, which leads into combat.

During the fight, as she unsheaths a flaming longsword, Lucienne drops a folder of papers. As Zhelezo guards start rushing into the building, Lucienne plane shifts away after seemingly summoning some reinforcements. Doloris quickly grabs the folder that Lucienne dropped, tucking it away before the guards get there. From behind T’hau and Rayna, three parrots appear, turning into imps. 

As she’s standing over his body, Mal recalls that Eliander deMatiz is member of one of the prominent noble families of Nicodranas. As the guards move in closer, the group attempts to at least make it seem like they’re trying to help Eliander, pointing out the devils to the guards as well. 

Stormbreaker and Rayna come up with a ruse, the former asking the latter to set them on fire. Whilst on fire, Stormbreaker runs into the other room towards where the guards, claiming he’s Asmodeus. It works, scaring off the guards, though they do seem to have seen Mal, Doloris, and Eliander’s body. 

They discuss how to handle Eliander’s body, Mal sharing he’s from a well-known family in the city. They decide to burn the body to hopefully make it unrecognisable. They then put the burnt body on the pile of bodies Stormbreaker found in the other room. 

They start looking for a way out. A patrol of Zhelezo is approaching, along with a Golden Chain sergeant. The two guards that were just inside are talking to them. T’hau and Rayna note that the Golden Chain sergeant is calming down the Zhelezo guard that seem upset. There’s also some concerned citizens on the opposite side of the street. Their best bet is to exit through the back, which faces an alley. 

They try to sneak out quietly, one guard spots some of the group though. They rush back towards the Restless Wharf, making their way back towards the Serpent’s Tide. 

At the ship, Doloris holds up the folder with papers she found. They head into the ship to check out the papers. Some of the papers have infernal writing on it. Another one is in celestial, a contract signed by Guillaume de Montfort and [[Uqaviel the Requiant]]. It’s about shepherding souls into the Nine Hells. There’s another contract, this one in common. Signed by Guillaume and two seemingly Elven brothers. It’s about the production of twenty ships figureheads a year of special wood that according to the contract, will slowly siphon away souls. The wood is called briarblaze thorn. They decide to maybe head into town later to find a Comprehend Languages scroll to translate the papers in infernal.

They take the documents to [[Gellan Primewater|Gellan]] and Eda later, after having the infernal ones translated as well. They share what happened at the Lavish Chateau with Gellan and Eda as well. Eda promises them she’ll look after them as far as the Zhelezo goes. 

T’hau asks Gellan and Eda what their end goal is with Guillaume. They say that with the paperwork provided, they could try and get both Guillaume and [[Commodore Balthair de Modesto|de Modesto]] replaced, hopefully with people who have the actual wellbeing of the people of Nicodranas in mind. The crew does advice against Gellan and Eda showing these documents at the next meeting, as Alvaro will be present, and they know he’s involved with the Golden Chain. 
Gellan shares with the crew that he’s been talking with the captain as well, and they’ve set up fully legal trades for the Serpent’s Tide.

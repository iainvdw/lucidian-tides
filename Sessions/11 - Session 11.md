Town crier really early in the morning. Calling on everyone in information on Louise de Montfort, involvement in killing a nobleman. 5000gp reward.

Doloris runs out to shut him up. Asks him to leave. Town crier seems to be looking for a bribe, Doloris gives him 2gp and guy walks off. Pamphlet mentions any reports should be sent to Cecelin Auvrindar.

We discuss what to do next. We split up, where Mal visits the temple to lay low and warn Obaya that the Commander is coming to Nicodranas, and the others visit the tannery to investigate the explosion.

We head into the Skew, industrial part of town, fewer Zhelezo.

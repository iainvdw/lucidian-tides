Town crier really early in the morning. Calling on everyone in information on Louise de Montfort, involvement in killing a nobleman. 5000gp reward.

Doloris runs out to shut him up. Asks him to leave. Town crier seems to be looking for a bribe, Doloris gives him 2gp and guy walks off. Pamphlet mentions any reports should be sent to Cecelin Auvrindar.

We discuss what to do next. We split up, where Mal visits the temple to lay low and warn Obaya that the Commander is coming to Nicodranas, and the others visit the tannery to investigate the explosion.

We head into the Skew, industrial part of town, fewer Zhelezo. Canals sends water into some buildings, water powers a lot of equipment through town. Square with builders around it, on western side a mine, that tunnels straight down from the square. First shift of the mine is just starting up.

T'hau notices the blast radius that indicated an explosion, centered on a single tub, rocketed out 30ft in diameter. Pieces of rock molten from a chemical burn. Sounds coming from open double doors. Three people in industrial space, four huge barrels. Two humans, one halfling. Hoisting massive emphora, clay container, off of a wagon, but struggling with it.

Halfling calls over to me as soon as she sees me, asks me to help out with this container. With the extra help, we manage to put it on two large wooden beams. This emphora contains a black pudding, would be a massive problem if it fell.

Gnome comes walking out a Bram Chudderstone, chief alchemist at the tannery. A vat outside exploded, launched 30 liters toxic waste water, covering personnel. Some died, some heavily wounded from acid burns.

Somebody dropped something in one of the baths, violent agent, probably on purpose. Bam tells that they had eye witnesses seeing a dwarf drop something in the bath before it exploded. Brother of Willow was a witness of first hand. Bam Chudderstone did alchemical research on the blast side, has notes on what he found as the cause of the explosion.

Bram takes Rayna with him to show the notes in his workshop. Rayna walks into a workshop, figures it used to be very neat. Now has stacks of paperwork, two desks, one very cluttered. Bram walks over to the cluttered desk, where his notes on the compound are. Rayna also spots that the ceiling is partly open to the floor above. Spots creatures with long noses, pointy ears and wings out on the rafter above.

Going over the notes, Rayna seems to understand them quite a bit. One of the compounds Bram found is sulphur, which is well regulated by the Concord. They wouldn't have any use for this in the tannery, so it has to come from another source, probably black market. Rayna inquires about Bram pissing off anyone who would do this, but nothing comes to mind. Done a thorough investigation with the people who were able to speak. Description of a dwarf and mining equipment might have led to hasty conclusions.

Bram tells that the mine has been trying to buy out the tannery, to get the tubs outside off of the square so they can get more equipment in.

Willow knows from her brother's description that it was a female dwarf. Flynn was known to be very courteous and not likely to be the suspect.

The fumes in the tannery seem to take hold of Doloris for a moment, having her see her father for a few seconds. Doloris shakes out of it and sits down to recover for a moment. Doloris then suggests we go talk to Willow's brother.

Willow takes us there, end up at a small house. Walk into the living space, where a temporary bed has been set up so Willow's brother can get some books nearby. Various mechanical knick-knacks and equipment on the tables. Vennik lies on the bed, large acid burn covering their face.

Vennik cures and cleans the leather. A female dwarf, from mine direction, dropped in clumps of yellow-blue material. Difficult and dangerous work, various acids around. Dwarf was looking around when she walked between the tubs, probably scouting for an exit. She seemed intent to do this, knowing what to do. Had ring through her nose, had something like mining gear on her.

Foreman from the mine came up to Benja to sell the land of the tannery where the tubs are to the mine. The tannery is old fashioned, takes up a lot of space and resources. Other tanneries are modernising using magic. Benja didn't take up on the offer, didn't want to fire people when they are replaced with magic.

People don't tend to like the dwarves, obnoxious folk. Lots of stakeholders of the mine, Lady Sherome one of them. Nothing of note happening that they, except for Bram being a bit more jittery than usual. Benja is the owner, Bram is the alchemist, are like brothers. Bram wouldn't betray Benja, says Vennik.

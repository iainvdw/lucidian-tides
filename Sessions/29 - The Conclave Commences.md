[[T'hau]] addresses the captain, offering a speech about how they’re pretty sure they and the crew of [[The Serpent's Tide]] are the more real pirates, considering they’ve been fighting the [[The Revelry|Revelry]]’s enemies rather than boasting about attacking innocent merchant ships. [[Captain Maximillian Firetalon|Captain Firetalon]] correctly interprets this as a threat. Combat ensues.

The crew targets the captain, eventually managing to take him down. Lou takes his money and pays the barkeep for damages as the crew allows one of Firetalon’s crew to heal him. T’hau makes a point of standing up for his kind, emphasising they don’t take these insults lightly.  

Firetalon leaves, seeming embarrassed, with some of his crew in tow.  

They talk to Wave on Shore, one of Firetalon’s crew members, who apologises for the fight and helps clean up. They ask him about Firetalon’s opinion on Nicodranas, to which he explains most of them are from Marquet and they don’t really have much of a stake in Menagerie Coast business. He further explains that one of the captain’s men, Golden Claw, worships a desert goddess named Shebira, who seems to encourage strength and honour and such. Said goddess seems to be muddling the captain’s mind. He also points out they may have jeopardised the captain’s position, as he’s all about strength, and they took him down a notch. Some of the staff may now challenge him. 

Wave on Shore also mentions the total crew is about 47 now, and they have a tiefling locked up aboard the ship. They’re hoping to ransom him back to the de Montfort shipping company. Lou asks for the tiefling’s name: Rollins. She recognises this as [[Heddic Rollins|Heddic]], the lead navigator of the company. Very involved with the family business, but she’s not sure if he’s aware of the devilish sides of things.  

[[Mallory Calder|Lou]] counts the money from [[Captain Maximillian Firetalon|Firetalon]], estimating it’s about 4000 gold worth of gems and other money. She and T’hau exit the Bloated Cup and head back over towards the K’thaumi at [[The Muddy Hut]] to give them the money, the others stay behind in the bar. 

[[Doloris]], [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] and [[Stormbreaker|Storm]] spot a ship coming in, sailless, seemingly being pulled forward by luminescent jellyfish. Ice covers the hull, despite the tropical temperatures of this island.  

[[T'hau]] and Lou speak to Pock, handing him the money. He seems reluctant to take all of it, and seems somewhat worried this may have stirred up shit they’ll now have to deal with, but ultimately he’s grateful for what the crew did. T’hau and Lou stay for drinks.  

Over the course of the night, more and more ships seem to arrive for the conclave. 

Wave on Shore joins [[Doloris]] for some drinks during the night, asking her about [[Stormbreaker|Storm]]. He shares some of what he heard about Storm, saying people involved in the raid involving the refugees went missing. Doloris tells him to just ask Storm himself, which he does. 

Storm also hasn’t heard anything about people from his former crew having gone missing. Wave on Shore refers to it as a ghost story a lot of people who were part of that raid were hunted down and never heard from again. The ghost story says the ships that were targeted somehow survived and are now out for revenge. Rayna asks if they could go after Alvaro instead, pointing out some of the crew were likely rather innocent in the matter.  

The following morning, T’hau and Stormbreaker pick up their new weapons from the smithy. The crew also check out Ugon’s Misappropriate Magic Items, the stall they were pointed to the day before. 

As they’re talking to Ugon, the oak next to T’hau starts talking to them, asking for battle stories. T’hau shares the story of last night’s brawl. 

Ugon pulls a box from underneath the stall as Lou asks how much the trident is worth, pulling a lens from said box. Lou recognises the box from her father’s study. She asks about the box, Ugon sharing she got it from a crew who raided a de Montfort ship. Ouroboreosa. It was the crew of the Blind Sphinx. Ugon says the box was made in the City of Brass in the Elemental Plane of Fire, a symbol underneath, looking like a celtic knot, denoting as such. The symbol is called the titethra, symbolising ‘three-ness’. It is also the mark of a craftsman from the City of Brass.  

Lou suggests they get the arcane canon and the box, in exchange for the trident and 8000 gold, consulting with Doloris about how much they wish to spend.  

As Lou takes a closer look at the box, she notes some dancing flames in brass. The one Lou’s father has had a folding obelisk in the center, this one Lou now has, has a spiral that turns. 

Doloris escorts Ugon and the canon and music box back to the ship as T’hau and Lou head to the Muddy Hut to train the K’thaumi, as Pock requested the night before.  

Meanwhile, Rayne suggests she and Storm go surfing, clarifying she herself doesn’t want to surf, but it seems like he wants to. Doloris returns to the ship to find Rayna curled up on a surfboard, clearly uncomfortable. 

She shows the music box to Rayna, talk of the Elemental Plane of Fire having reminded Doloris of Rayna. She asks Rayna about her parents and she explains that whilst her parents aren’t from such a place, her biological parents might be. As Rayna takes a look at the music box, she notes it’s different from the one she saw her mother with. 

As she inspects the music box, some of her flames shoot into the bottom of the box, lighting up the strange symbol. The spiral inside the box starts to bloom up and a single obelisk unfurls from it. Symbols appear around it, hovering around the obelisk. 

Doloris recognises these as infernal, hellish symbols. They decide to wait til Lou comes back and close the box for now.

Doloris then points out the cannon to Rayna and Stormbreaker, the latter gets very excited about the cannon.  

Eventually the captain fetches the crew, telling them the conclave is in about an hour. They head through the crevasse and past the Muddy Hut, into a cave nearby. They follow the path up, emerging into a cavern with a large round pool. From underneath the water, Yucalia the Plank Queen emerges. She welcomes everyone to the first conclave under her name. She shares they have amassed quite some wealth, adding that almost half of it was gathered by the crew of the Serpent’s Tide. There’s some polite applause and nods. 

Firetallon is also present, not acknowledging the crew at all. He’s standing next to a huge minotaur. 

“We have big decisions to make on where we go from here,” the Plank Queen continues. “Let us begin.”

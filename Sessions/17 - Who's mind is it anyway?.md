[[T'hau|T’hau]] split off from the rest of the party to meet up with [[Alma Hyllyndre|Alma]] at the Cobalt Reserve. Asking about Salar turned Sage Ahvost pretty pale, he initially offered books that weren’t helpful. T’hau asked more questions, and was told about the book on Salar, though Ahvost said he couldn’t just give the book to them, needing permission from his boss.

T’hau is later given the book, though it came with numerous warnings. They were only given the book with the promise of them destroying it later. As they went through the book, he heard a voice: “Hello, Desmond. Are you looking for the city which eyes cannot see?”
The voice continues teasing them, offering them knowledge on whatever they want to know. The voice compels them to say a word, next saying they need some seawater. T’hau summons his echo, which reaches into the book and pulls out a stone containing three marbles. 

T’hau describes what they remember, mentioning the book and how they couldn’t stop thinking about where they come from. They say they came here to search for Bendira, claiming they found her and she and her people welcomed him. She and her people are known as the Sunken Ones. 

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] explains to T’hau what they’ve deduced, mentioning the pocket dimension in the book. T’hau says they pulled something from there. They explain they dropped it in a well. When asked, they explain they did all this cos they felt compelled to do so. Currently, they feel compelled to introduce the others to Bendira, as they know she wouldn’t like visitors. 

As they talk to T’hau, [[Stormbreaker]] senses something is off and at some point, Mal spots her old mentor, Aredhel, telling her there’s ‘fuckery afoot’. As Mal follows this apparation, she sees a much younger version of her sister Lucienne, saying ‘the time is soon’, before running away. 

She tells the others she’s seeing things, Stormbreaker suggests they go speak to Bendira to see what’s going on. With Mal seeing things, Stormbreaker sensing something off and T’hau behaving weirdly, [[Doloris]] says she doesn’t trust things and casts Detect Evil and Good. At the moment, she doesn’t pick up on anything. 

T’hau starts leading the others towards where Bendira is. There are five figures in the room he leads them to. Four humans and one water genasi. As [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] heads inside, she spots a small wooden box: a musical box that her mother had. She takes it, opening the box. A little wooden heart pops out of it as music plays.

When she looks up, she finds herself somewhere else. Finds herself in a bar of sorts, with heraldry of House [[Guillaume de Montfort|de Montfort]]. 

Bendira speaks of finding knowledge, saying they intend on using Iluun and her kind to find said knowledge. Iluun is currently being birthed in a well through a door to the north. Doloris points out that Iluun and her kind enslaved T’hau and his kind, to which Bendira counters that they instead created T’hau and his kind. Mal points out that them creating and then enslaving people isn’t really any better. 

The crew speak of stopping this ‘birthing’ process, then head inside. As the door opens, Doloris sees her father in the doorway, acknowledging that she is now also seeing things.
Stormbreaker spots a stone at the buttom of the well in this room. Instead of his own reflection, he sees the reflection of his grandmother in the water. The crew discusses what to do as Bendira starts saying they should leave. Doloris notes a powdery substance on Bendira’s fingers. She says it’s vision crystal. The tension grows, eventually leading to combat.

During the fight, T’hau manages to shake whatever has a hold on their mind, quickly coming to their friends’ aid. 

Mal, having jumped into the well, scoops up the stone. She finds herself elsewhere. Her father urges her to be careful, there’s bodies around her, on the floor. Doloris is there, bloody wings at either side. Her father threatens Doloris by cocking a gun to her head and Mal hears a voice: ‘you are destined to destroy her’. 

She shakes this vision, misty stepping back towards the others. Combat continues. Stormbreaker manages to take down Bendira, the rest taking care of the remaining cultists as one last one dimension doors themselves away. T’hau gets the final blow on the last remaining cultist, who picked up the bucket with the stone, which now drops to the floor.

Rayna and Stormbreaker destroy the stone, making it crumble into pieces. Doloris moves over to Bendira, bringing her back to consciousness. Rayna moves out the room. Doloris asks Bendira how she now feels about Iluun, but it feels that breaking the stone didn’t change Bendira’s mind about wanting to use Iluun and her kind for knowledge. She turns to T’hau, but they, now no longer under control, point out enslavement is not pleasant, and they were just here under some sort of spell. They point out that anything they could’ve learned from Iluun would’ve felt useless as they were enslaved.

Bendira mentions Etienne, asking if T’hau wouldn’t have wanted to learn more about them. They say they would’ve, but not like this. Stormbreaker points out they as a group may have wanted to help Bendira had she just been straight with them. 

Mal goes to check on Rayna, who says she’s still trying to calm herself down. She says usually things go bad when she loses control like she just did, but this time it worked out. Mentions her parents having tried to reign her in before, but it never really worked. She’s finding her own way of controlling it. Rayna mentions her dads, how they encouraged her to learn how to work with nature, as that tends to heal. Mal points out she thinks fire can bring life too. 

The conversation turns to Rayna being hurt from the fight, Mal pointing out Doloris should take a look at it. Rayna shares she was impressed with Bendira’s fighting, pointing out Stormbreaker needs a hammer to do as much damage. As Doloris comes over to heal Rayna, Mal tells Stormbreaker what Rayna just said. He sheds a single manly tear.

The group reconvenes and they talk about what to do with Bendira. T’hau speaks to Alma about what will be best, Alma suggesting they can turn Bendira over to Overseer Kelren of the Cobalt Soul. Bendira asks if she can bring her vision crystal, as no one else knows what to do with it. The group agree to bring it but not necessarily letting her having it, instead wanting to give this to the Cobalt Soul as well. The crew make sure to search the area as well as the people’s bodies. 

They find two bracers (Bracers of Defense), as well as a magical book of sorts (Tome of Understanding) kept in Bendira’s quarters. The tome is written in Naush. Bendira pleads with T’hau to use her crystal again, she can use to maybe guide them to more answers about their people. T’hau allows her to do this.

Bendira mentions their kind were created, and that they have a mindlink of sorts. Iluun was able to get through to T’hau’s actual memories. She mentions them remembering someone called Etienne. Bendira invites T’hau to collect some of the crystal dust as well, which they do after a moment of hesitation. Using the crystal dust, they see the same woman they saw before. Etienne de Thauville. [[T'hau|Thau]] was her nickname, as she hated her first name; it was a man’s name, her dad’s name. Her dad is the one they were running away from. Someone like her couldn’t be with someone like them: Desmond, a simple fisherboy. 

T’hau questions the legitimacy of these visions, saying they’ve seen many faces in dreams. Bendira looks at him, suggesting she never lied to him, she simply did what she thought was right. T’hau urges her to educate herself on aboleth, suggesting she abandon her trail of research. She seems reluctant, mentioning a Captain Valeria. She says her endgoal is all knowledge, free. T’hau asks her at what cost she hopes to obtain this. 

T’hau recalls that Etienne’s father was the portcaller at Brokenbank. Mal knows that Etienne’s daughter, Thau, has recently taken over her father’s work. She’s a woman in her fifties. She was on a shortlist of possible allies, due to her position as not a Marquis.

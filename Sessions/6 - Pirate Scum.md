We follow [[Doloris]] through the Undercellar, as we are suddenly spotted by a dwarf and a bugbear near a door. They notice [[Kirour Grimblade]] and call out to him. [[T'hau]] grabs him and ask him to tell his friends to back off. Kirour ignores that request, seeing this as an opportunity for him to be freed.

The dwarf gets out his weapons, while the bugbear tries to lock down a door he's standing in front of. [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] senses something fiendish nearby as she approaches the bugbear guarding door. A parrot that sat on the dwarfs shoulder is commanded to fly away and warn others. Rayna's fire bolt doesn't seem to harm the parrot, leading us to believe the parrot was the fiendish spirit that Mal sensed. 

Combat with the dwarf ensues, and we quickly manage to take care of him.

A loud scream can be heard coming from behind the door. Doloris pushes the bugbear out of the way and opens the door. A young woman in a nightgown emerges, and starts thanking us. She then asks us to take her back up top, pointing to her manacled feet. Tells us her name is Enna. Bugbear seems very scared of her, telling us it's not wise to free her and let her go. Enna tells us she has no idea what the bugbear is talking about, but [[Doloris]] doesn't seem to trust Enna, seeing through her lies, telling her we might push her back inside if she doesn't start telling the truth.

The bugbear finally gives in and tells us she was staying with the [[Myriad]], messing with everyone's dreams. They put her away once before, but she managed to escape. This time they were intent to put her away for good. This description leads [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] to believe Enna is a night hag. That would also explain the manacles on her feet, as runes are carved into them that would lock her to this plane.

When we were talking with the bugbear and not directly engaging with Enna, she tried to make her escape, running towards the exit past [[Doloris]] and [[Mallory Calder|Mal]]. Mal tries to trip her, but Enna somehow manages to dodge her, even with her manacled feet. Then Doloris tries to knock Enna out with a boomerang, and with a swift throw she knocks Enna down. [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] then ensnares them with a spell, and manages to restrain Enna. The bugbear then takes Enna back to the room and locks her up for good.

[[Kirour Grimblade|Kirour]] starts shouting to the bugbear that he should run, but the bugbear seems to ignore him. Rayna asks how the parrot didn't seem to be harmed by fire. Bugbear doesn't know for sure, but mentions the parrot was summoned from the dwarf's ring. We search the dwarf's body and take their ring.

The exit through Lot 32 is just up ahead, and leads to a small empty cellar. There's a few wooden supports for casks, and a ladder leads up to a hatch. We exit on the periphery of the Wide. We see drunks are being brushed out of taverns and inns, as it's quite late already.

We decide to make our way to the Counting House on the docks to deliver [[Kirour Grimblade|Kirour]] and one barrel as proof. [[Zhelezo]] guards on the balcony notice us as we approach, and ask what our business is. A Zhelezo officer emerges a moment later, asking what the fuss is about this late of an hour. We present Kirour and the barrel and make our case, telling the guard that Kirour approached us with an illicit deal and turned on us when we refused. 

The guard doesn't immediately take Kirour in, as they want to check our accusations, but they'll have to do that the following day. When we additionally mention [[Myriad|The Myriad]], the guard seems very surprised. Kirour shouts that the guard should mention their name to [[First Sergeant Brehkan]]. We tell the guard that we learned that the Myriad is in cahoots with the [[Golden Chain]]. The officer mentions that they will do their best to avoid the First Sergeant and deal with this solely with other Zhelezo, as not to wake any sleeping dogs. They don't have any space in The Counting House to hold someone prisoner though, so he requests we hold on to Kirour while they check on our accusations. We negotiate a small fee for our troubles and take Kirour to the ship.

On the ship, we immediately put [[Kirour Grimblade|Kirour]] in the brig and get some rest after a long day. For a while, Kirour is acting like a petulant child, as [[Stormbreaker]] and [[T'hau]] take turns guarding him.

[[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] goes to check on her plants in the broom closet, and a single green bud is growing from the soil in one of her pots. It's a bud of a nutmeg shrub. Iggy scuttles up Rayna's shoulder, and looks at her. Rayna tells it not to burn the plant. Iggy braces himself for a moment and the cracks in its obsidian body glow up, seemingly asking if this place needs more light.

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] investigates the ring and learns that it is magic. It's magic however is tied to a fiendish patron and would need its wielder to make a pact with one to utilise its power. The gem seems like it's worth quite a bit of money, but only after the magic would have subsided over some time.

Later during that morning, four [[Zhelezo]] show up, one wearing an officer's uniform, a woman with long red hair. Introduces herself as captain Levenia. Confirmed to us that eight casks were stolen, and then starts asking if we know where the other casks are, as we have only presented one as evidence. [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] says Kirour only approached us with one, but captain Levenia doesn't seem to fully buy the story.

Mal takes the captain Levenia down to the brig, who then starts interrogating Kirour. After a short interrogation, she again asks us about the remaining barrels.[[Stormbreaker]] tries to make up a bullshit story about us drinking the other seven barrels, but captain Levenia sees through our lies. Stormbreaker finally gives in and tells her that we have them, and we'll deliver all the barrels to them. Having dealt with that, she mentions there is a price of 500gp on Kirour's head. Asking if there is any other worthwhile information, we tell captain Levenia that Kirour named [[Commander Da'urlo Vidorant|Vidorant]] sanctioning [[Myriad]] business in the Undercellar. That does worry the Zhelezo quite a bit, as they are relatively powerless in [[Nicodranas]]

As we update the captain on what just happened, Stormbreaker has a flashback to a similar situation from a while ago. 

> "Captain Alvaro!" a voice yells down from the portside windlass. "The scouts are rounding the corner!" 
> 
> Alvaro, standing next to you, doesn't flinch and remains hunched over a nautical map of the Bisaft Archipelago. 
> 
> "I heard him." 
> 
> "Captain Alvaro!" the voice repeats, closer this time. Keeping his eyes on the nautical map, Alvaro seems to wait until he can hear the incoming footsteps.
> 
> Then, with all the regal weight that thirty years spent in the Concord Fleet gives to a man, he straightens up and turns towards the figure.
> 
> This young duty officer's brisk walk falters, coming to an abrupt halt. "Uh.. sir", as soon as he locks eyes with Alvaro, his voice falls away. 
> 
> Alvaro lets the silence hang in the air for a handful of heartbeats. "We are not in a cattle market in the Tumbledowns, leftennant Yarrik. This is the helm of a commanding frigate of the Clovis Concord. Routine information is not-simply shouted in the general direction of its intended recipient. Is that clear?"   
> 
> The young lad swallows. "Yes sir."
> 
> Alvaro locks his eyes a few seconds longer, then lowers his head in a slight nod. "Now. Report."
> 
> "Yes, sir." Yarrik swallowed again. "We've just received signals from the scouting ships, sir: the river loses any depts about a mile inland."
> 
> "Very good." Alvaro nods. "Dismissed."

We finish up the business with the Zhelezo, delivering [[Kirour Grimblade|Kirour]] and the remaining barrels to The Counting House for the 500gp reward.

The group splits up, [[Doloris]] and [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] staying behind to take another look at the Briarblaze Heart. [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]], [Stormbreaker] and [[T'hau]] head to Primewater Hall to see if they can sell the silk.

As we approach the door, we are greeted again by Ezekiel. Mentioning that we have silk to sell, he says he'll check with Mr. Primewater. We are taken inside, past a bathhouse and a ballroom. We are taken to a semicircular office, with a view of the luxurious garden behind the mansion. We present the silk to [[Gellan Primewater|Mr. Primewater]], and he says is interested, but would like to know where we obtained it. [[Stormbreaker]] hints that we obtained it from an exotic place. [[Gellan Primewater|Mr. Primewater]] will buy the silk from us, in return for a favour. Rumours came in recently that bones started floating up near a popular fishing spot, and fishermen are avoiding this spot now. Helping the fishermen in his name would gain him a few favours with his voters as well, so there's a win-win situation. He tells us that we can check with LÃ©on & Thirellia Handasher, fishmongers running Handasher Fish on The Wide.

[[Gellan Primewater|Mr. Primewater]] suggests to also get acquainted with Ida, the councilwoman running The Skew, and the Montfort family. The three of them usually get a majority vote on the council, which might help in his and our favour. He shares there have always been rumours about the de Montfort family, but Primewater thinks they handle things in their own way.

Meanwhile on the ship, [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] and [[Doloris]] are researching the documents again. They figure the Lushgut forest contains something very powerful. It's known for being quite impenetrable, a very dense jungle. Some symbols on the document make very little sense to Doloris, but they seem vaguely Elvish in nature. Some elves worship Avandra, most notably the pallid elves. They remember [[Captain Cassian Sariel de Rochefort|Captain Sariel]] is a pallid elf as well, and fetch him to get some more information. The captain recalls the Pallid Grove and as he takes a look at the map, he tells that they are symbols for benevolent nature spirits. There's a children's story that they guard the most sacred places that Melora and Avandra explored together. Mal and Doloris also show the flask with the blue liquid, and the captain recognises it as Moon Oil. Captain points to a symbol on the map, a bear-like figure hanging from a branch, a spirit called Zorbo. Tells that we could ask that spirit for guidance, at the ruins of Sepesca.

[[Captain Cassian Sariel de Rochefort|Captain Sariel]] relays that [[Obaya]] came by yesterday, saying she wanted to go pray at the local temple. Obaya came to thank them from saving her from what happened to the priestess of that temple; sheâs not heading back to [[Port Zoon]] at the moment, sheâs hiding out here in [[Nicodranas]]. Captain suggests they investigate this whole thing a little more before going anywhere. 

The two groups eventually reconvene and catch up with each other. When [[Stormbreaker]] mentions that [[Gellan Primewater|Mr. Primewater]] suggested that we get acquainted with the Montfort family, [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] is quick to object. The Montforts are not known to be kind to anyone working for them. Adding to that, apparently they also came back from Avernus quite a bit earlier than the rest of the city, suggesting they made some devilish deal at some great cost, probably lives.

They decide to tackle one thing at a time and after some discussion about an appropriate amount of bones, they head to the fishermen Primewater said they should talk to. We find the fishmongers on the Wide to ask about the bones. Thirellia Handasher greets us and asks us if we would like to buy some fish. [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] then mentions we are here on account of [[Gellan Primewater|Mr. Primewater]] and would like to know more about the bones. Leon comes forward and tells us that in [[Natchuala Bay]] bones started drifting up, even a skull among them. The wind started to pick up, there were strange noises and a horrible wind. Some of the bones had strange cuts on them. We tell them we will look into the matter.

Back on the ship, we decide to investigate the bay the next day. After dinner we head out to the Helm & Cloak to see if we can learn more about the party. [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] is looking around for a game in the bar, and notices two [[Zhelezo]] counting coin, laughing at someone at the bar, who's a bit too deep into their drink. Seems like they are betting on that person keeping it together. Rayna approaches the two Zhelezo guards, asking if there's something less boring to do around here. Rayna asks if there are parties around here, and the Zhelezo mentions the party in about a week. They name the guy at the bar as Devlon, and mention he has guard duty on party night as he showed up drunk to work one day.

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] looks around if she spots her friend Ava, not noticing her in the packed crowd. A moment later, Mal suddenly hears her named called out from a booth, as she turns around and notices Ava sitting there with a few friends. Ava seems pretty drunk, telling Mal that she finds that she needs this from time to time. Mal seems to cut through it all and thinks that she is going through something. Mal asks if she wants another drink and the two sit at the bar. Mal orders a water for Ava instead of ale and asks her if all is ok. Ava opens up and mentions that there is some trouble with the [[Golden Chain]], a liaison by the name of Yuzza Ribbond. Asking about the Golden Chain, Ava tells they got involved when [[Nicodranas]] came back, few [[Zhelezo]] were left. Concord sent the Golden Chain from [[Port Damali]] to guard the city until they recruited enough Zhelezo to replace them. The city council and [[Clovis Concord|Concord]] seemingly want to keep The Golden Chain here, instead of restoring the Zhelezo. Mal's father has a big vote in that matter. Mal could convince her father to vote the Golden Chain out.

Meanwhile on the ship, [[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]] is alone on deck smoking his pipe, pondering over [[The Serpent's Tide]]'s deck and out over the sea. All seems quiet and peaceful for a moment, when he's suddenly startled at the last second by footsteps behind him. As he turns around, he feels a sword enters his stomach, and a strong poison enters his body. Just moments later, Bartholomew blacks out.

When we get back to the ship later, we notice something in the sails. Text is written on the sails in large, bloody lettering: "Pirate scum". As we board, we see innards and ribbons of flesh are strewn all over the deck and rigging. And then we spot the mangled remains of Bartholomew Brittlestone...

There’s a moment’s reprieve before the crew realise that one of the other ship’s horn is stuck in the hull of the Serpent’s Tide and their ship is taking on water. They rush to try and fix this as Lou gets herself stuck in the captain’s quarters with what seems to be an angry fire skull. On deck of the other ship, Doloris sees foamy sea water crawling away from the sea hag’s body. Rayna manages to convince some large jellyfish to help stabilize the ship. 

They manage to take care of the flame skull as well as the sea hag, though T’hau does go unconscious. Doloris gets him back up and they discuss how to handle the situation with the merfolk. They agree they’ll take Gorehorn and the sea hag’s body to the merfolk, giving the other ship back to the remaining minotaur crew. They agree to message the Plank Queen to update her on the situation, also putting in a good word for the remaining minotaur so they hopefully get given a second chance by the Plank Queen, as it seems they were merely following orders. 

The crew move Gorehorn and the sea hag’s body to their ship, searching the Raging Torrent for anything else of interest. They find four barrels of tobacco, eight barrels of gunpowder and five crates of strange white and blue crystals. The crew of the Serpent’s Tide repairs the hull. 

Doloris finds a siren’s larynx in the hag’s quarters. Lou determines it seems magical and can be used to amplify your voice (Charm Monsters, DC 14). She also looks at Gorehorn’s scimitars, which seem to be from Marquet. They are magical weapons (+1), which also seem to have a command word that causes flames to erupt. After taking stock, the crew set course to Karakala.

The journey there takes some two weeks. Storm and the captain discuss tactics on approaching Nicodranas, as well as how to approach the merfolk. He also shares that the Plank Queen treated the surviving minotaurs amicably. 
As they get closer to Bwualli, a storm rolls in. 

They agree to have Stormbreaker, Lou and T’hau head down, as they can all swim and breathe underwater. They dive in, bringing the crown and the conch down with them. 
As they get closer, they take notice of the destruction of the coral reefs around them. There’s a whole civilization under here and the three are eventually approached by what seems to be some guards. Storm says they’re here to return some stolen goods, asking if they can speak to the Stormcaller. Noting the wounds on some of the guards, Storm adds they can also give them the corpse of the person who did that to them. 
The female guard introduces herself as Thirien, then asks them to follow her closely, which they do. 

Aboard the Serpent’s Tide, Doloris and Rayna note a blue-ish light, a strange bobbing orb appearing. More appear, about five of them. The lantern of revealing shows these previously invisible orbs. Doloris takes a closer look, getting zapped by electricity as she gets a little too close. The orb seems surprised that Doloris could see it. Rayna attempts to convince the orbs that they come in peace. It looks like the orbs start to clump together, drawn to the lantern. 

Doloris recalls stories of balled lightning, a natural phenomenon that happens to ships caught in storms. She doesn’t think that’s it though - she thinks these are willow whisps, lost souls who came to a violent end and still haunt the places where they were slain. 

Storm, T’hau and Lou are led into a cavern. Inside are a number of wounded merfolk that are being treated for their injuries. The Stormcaller approaches them and they speak. They hand over the crown as well as the conch. When the crew mentions the bodies, T’hau is send back up to the ship with Elok, one of the merfolk, to verify the claims. He’s also asked to bring back Doloris, who may be able to offer some healing to the injured.

Storm and Lou continue speaking to the Stormcaller, asking for his permission to use the conch. He agrees, then asks for the crew to send a message to Yucalia as well; they value her friendship and they hope she will one day wear that crown. They hope she can reunite their people. 

As they wait for T’hau and Doloris to return, Storm and Lou offer to help out here in any way they can. Thirien shows them to their new camps and new enclosures for their herds of fish, which they can help with.

Doloris and Rayna attempt to communicate with the willow whisps, start hearing whispers on the wind. They seem to say hello back in Elvish, which the captain understands. 
T’hau emerges alongside his new guard friend and he’s quickly caught up about the willow wisp situation. Elok shares the willow wisps won’t cling to the ship; he didn’t know they were popping up again though. He says he will ask their shaman to start with their lament again. 

T’hau then explains they’re here to see the bodies, so Doloris brings the bodies up to towards the deck. Elok inspects them, throwing a javelin at Gorehorn’s body for good measure. T’hau then asks Doloris to come down with them, as some healing was requested. 

Eventually, the Stormcaller himself inspects the bodies as well. Doloris keeps one of Gorehorn’s horns. Everyone who wants to, is invited for dinner below the sea by the merfolk. 

The merfolk sing a mournful, melancholy melody and on deck, Rayna notices the willow wisps disappear, floating down into the water. The others see the orbs drift down into the coral around them, which seems to give the coral some life back. 

After dinner is done, Storm, Doloris, T’hau and Lou make their way back to the ship.

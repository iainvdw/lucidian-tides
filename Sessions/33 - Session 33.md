- Rayna awakes to muffled cries of terror. Her ears seem to be covered and there’s a cloth over her eyes as well. She’s being carried by her father, Kish, his cloak covering her eyes and ears as he tries to shield her from whatever’s going on. Kish and Naveed talk about trying to help with what’s happening. Kish attempts to distract Rayna, suggesting she sing a song. The song she hums is that of the music box. 
    
- They start moving away, a voice calling out after them. A blue skinned tiefling asks to see what Kish is carrying, pulling the cloak away to reveal Rayna. The tiefling is wearing black armor, sharply contrasting with the surrounding area; Rayna’s neighborhood, on fire. 
    
- Her fathers have always been vague about this moment whenever Rayna asked about it later in life. They assured her that the fire was not her fault.  
      
    
- In present time, Rayna and Lou are working on mending some minor damage to the ship. Rayna notes that Lou is humming the same tune she was just thinking off. as the Serpent’s Tide glides through dark waters. 
    
- Rayna and Lou speak about what she just remembered, as well as tieflings and music boxes.
    
- T’hau joins them on deck, as they and Lou agreed to get some sparring done with their new scimitars. They discuss talking to the tiefling, deciding to bring in the ‘good cops’ aka Storm and Doloris.  
      
    
- They ask Heddic about the music box, he asks about whether or not they’ve started humming the tune yet. He shares that the obelisk that can be seen in the music box is a real thing and that gets summoned when all three music boxes are together. He doesn’t know what it holds. 
    
- He suggests that if they want answers, they should hum the tune with the box open. Eventually, he says that one of the crew on the other ship did this. A circle of flame appeared, with an individual appearing in the center of it. She managed to pit that crew against each other; she was after the box.  
      
    
- After some discussion, they agree to wait til tomorrow. Doloris will cast Sending into her Ioun Stone so Rayna can reach out to her mom to ask her if her box is still safe. Then, they will make a lead box that can hopefully contain the music box, to cancel out its magic. Then, they will try to summon this golden devil that Heddic described to see if they can speak to her.  
      
    
- The following day, they do as they previously agreed. Rayna and Storm work together to make a lead box. Doloris hands the Ioun Stone to Rayna, but the crew agrees they should reach out to Rayna’s mom after they speak to the gold lady.
    
- They open the music box and Lou hums the song. There’s a moment of pause, before a gold-skinned tiefling woman with purple hair appears on deck. 
    
- After some brief back and forth, Kasadya gives her name, both Storm and Lou give her their names in turn. When Lou mentions her father, she says that the two of them no longer see eye to eye. She knows a ‘colleague’ of hers may be very familiar to Lou - she changes her face into that of Cecilin, Lou’s childhood nanny. 
    
- Lord de Montfort was originally collecting the boxes for Mammon. Since Mammon was destroyed, he’s had other plans. He turned down Cecilin’s advances and killed her. He now seems to want to collect the boxes for someone called Portentia.  
      
    
- She offers to take the box of their hands, which the group suggests they should discuss. Rayna, now charmed by Kasadya, is in favor of giving the box to her. Lou, now cursed by the music box, is unwilling to let it go. They put it to a vote, Lou, T’hau and Doloris getting the majority vote in saying that they keep the box and not give it to Kasadya. 
    
- They tell her this and in turn, she charms Stormbreaker as well. Doloris nudges Lou, who tries to sneak forward and cast Mending on the summoning circle, but Kasseia catches her and lashes out with her stinger tail.
    
- This leads to a fight, full of charm effects and curses. They manage to calm down the fight a bit, asking for a moment to take another vote. They tentatively agree to give Kasseia the box, but Lou suggests she try something before they do so.  
      
    
- Louise sees the three boxes, a red-skinned Efreeti wearing shackles is carving into the wood of the boxes. He inspects his work, a voice from beyond asking him if it’s done. Addresses the Efreeti as Vukaa. Vukaa confirms this, saying the obelisk is safe, addressing the other voice as Mr Moloch. Two other creatures step into frame; a sickly skinned snake, wearing a fine vest of platinum silk (compliments Vukaa on his work, pronouncing him Vukaa the Freed) and a red-skinned devil with a very monstrous face and muscular body. The snake then pronounces the devil as the next leader of the Sixth. 
    
- Lou recognises the yellow snake as Mammon, Moloch is the ruler of the Sixth layer of Hell (Malbolge), the name of Vukaa doesn’t necessarily ring a bell. She does know that one of the most humiliating things that can happen to an efreet is to become a slave. There was a ruler before Moloch, Glasya. The daughter of Asmodeus. The patron saint for evil politicians, liars and schemers.  
      
    
- Lou shares this with the others, at which point Kasadya adds that it is the voice of Glasya that is stuck. She also says that she can still be of service to the group. After some more discussion, they agree to give Kasadya the box, in exchange for her making sure it doesn’t land in Alvaro or de Montfort’s hands, and helping them find Alvaro. The latter by means of imps, and should the imps fail, she will provide them with a scrying mirror. 
    
- Kasadya then leaves after Storm signs the deal she writes out.  
      
    
- Rayna asks Lou about the figures she saw, freaking out a little. She says that her mother told her that her biological father was the one who gave her the music box, so she now thinks that may be Vukaa. She decides to ask her mom about this with the Sending spell, also asking about the music box, urging her mom to keep it safe.
    
- Her mother responds quickly, telling her she moved to the nearby mountains. She also says she put Naveed, one of Rayna’s adoptive dads, on a boat to Nicodranas. She ends by saying that Kish, Rayna’s other adoptive dad, got taken.

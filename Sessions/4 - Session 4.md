Doloris heads into town, towards the temple of Melora. She knows that it can be accessed by sea or the undercellar. Nearest entrypoint would be the Blushing Mermaid and Doloris heads there.

Orc mentions that if the gate is locked, try one of the other tunnels. If it gets rowdy, people get there asking for a way out.

Doloris enter the tunnel, echoes can be heard from up ahead. Tunnel has multiple portcullises.

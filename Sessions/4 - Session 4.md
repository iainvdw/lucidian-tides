Doloris heads into town, towards the temple of Melora. She knows that it can be accessed by sea or the undercellar. Nearest entrypoint would be the Blushing Mermaid and Doloris heads there.

Wooden mermaid hangs over the door

Orc mentions that if the gate is locked, try one of the other tunnels. If it gets rowdy, people get there asking for a way out.

Doloris enter the tunnel, echoes can be heard from up ahead. Tunnel has multiple portcullises. She heads further into the tunnel, getting to a T section where she sees a marking of a staff with the symbol of Melora leading right. She heads in that direction, floor gets wet.

This section seems somewhat industrial. Large tubes fill the place, stretching large portions of the tunnels. Doloris hears some metal being kicked over, followed by elven curse.

Doloris walks around the corner and greets the lady. Angered looking sea elf standing next to her, seems to be the one that knocked over a brazier with embers.

Sea witch mentions that she isn't taking visitors at this point. Doloris asks if she is the lady of the temple. Acolyte Lyrndal laughs at the question. Woman mentions that the real lady is taken into custody, for refusing an order of the [[Clovis Concord]]. Doloris offers some help. Sister Fariah mentions that Lady Sahea is taken to Port Damali to see the Grand Admiral.

Doloris mentions that she intends to vanquish the oppression in the city. Asking how Doloris wants to do that, she mentions the Revelry. They give the impression that Doloris isn't the first one to make such a suggestion.

Couple of people came to the temple to use it as a smuggling route. Didn't belong to the Revelry, but to the Myriad. Were more rude, mention sea hag, would eventually bow to their demands. Doloris tries to gain their trust by offering her help in a more sensible approach by building a relationship. Sister Fariah seems interested, but isn't too sure if it's entirely agreeable, but is open to meeting the rest of the crew. Myriad intends to show up with wares to smuggle, without approval of the temple. Suggests we might be able to help out.

At the stake-out, we decide on our next step and decide to get to the Helm & Cloak. We try to exit stealthily, Mal trips but T'hau catches her and masks her with his carapace turning into the same stone colour as the wall.

We head into White Cliffs, fairly nice neighbourhood second to the Opal Archways. Get to the Helm & Cloak, seems like three buildings combined into one. Four floors, two turrets.

Terrace has a number of people still in uniform. Inside there are fewer people. Big dwarf is running the bar, almost bald, short well kept beard, tattooed knuckles in dwarven script. Bartender says lots of Golden Chain folks hiring rooms in the tavern, not happy with housing situation.

We head outside, find a table. [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] and [[T'hau]] try to pick up on some conversations. Mal hears a Golden Chain guard talk about a party.

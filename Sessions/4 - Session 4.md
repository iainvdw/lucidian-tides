Doloris heads into town, towards the temple of Melora. She knows that it can be accessed by sea or the undercellar. Nearest entrypoint would be the Blushing Mermaid and Doloris heads there.

Wooden mermaid hangs over the door

Orc mentions that if the gate is locked, try one of the other tunnels. If it gets rowdy, people get there asking for a way out.

Doloris enter the tunnel, echoes can be heard from up ahead. Tunnel has multiple portcullises. She heads further into the tunnel, getting to a T section where she sees a marking of a staff with the symbol of Melora leading right. She heads in that direction, floor gets wet.

This section seems somewhat industrial. Large tubes fill the place, stretching large portions of the tunnels. Doloris hears some metal being kicked over, followed by elven curse.

Doloris walks around the corner and greets the lady. Angered looking sea elf standing next to her, seems to be the one that knocked over a brazier with embers.

Sea witch mentions that she isn't taking visitors at this point. Doloris asks if she is the lady of the temple. Acolyte Lyrndal laughs at the question. Woman mentions that the real lady is taken into custody, for refusing an order of the [[Clovis Concord]]. Doloris offers some help. Sister Fariah mentions that Lady Sahea is taken to Port Damali to see the Grand Admiral.

Doloris mentions that she intends to vanquish the oppression in the city. Asking how Doloris wants to do that, she mentions the Revelry. They give the impression that Doloris isn't the first one to make such a suggestion.

Couple of people came to the temple to use it as a smuggling route. Didn't belong to the Revelry, but to the Myriad. Were more rude, mention sea hag, would eventually bow to their demands. Doloris tries to gain their trust by offering her help in a more sensible approach by building a relationship. Sister Fariah seems interested, but isn't too sure if it's entirely agreeable, but is open to meeting the rest of the crew. Myriad intends to show up with wares to smuggle, without approval of the temple. Suggests we might be able to help out.

At the stake-out, we decide on our next step and decide to get to the Helm & Cloak. We try to exit stealthily, Mal trips but T'hau catches her and masks her with his carapace turning into the same stone colour as the wall.

We head into White Cliffs, fairly nice neighbourhood second to the Opal Archways. Get to the Helm & Cloak, seems like three buildings combined into one. Four floors, two turrets.

Terrace has a number of people still in uniform. Inside there are fewer people. Big dwarf is running the bar, almost bald, short well kept beard, tattooed knuckles in dwarven script. Bartender says lots of Golden Chain folks hiring rooms in the tavern, not happy with housing situation.

We head outside, find a table. [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] and [[T'hau]] try to pick up on some conversations. Mal hears a Golden Chain guard talk about a party.

Suddenly, we hear someone call out "Lou" behind us. Mal turns around as she recognizes the voice. Asks what she is doing here, mentions she died. Says her parents say she's dead, Mal scoffs at her parents, saying that they are liars. We learn Mal's actual name is Louise.

Avelina asks what Mal is doing here if she is dead. Mal mentions that she's here on trading business. Avelina wears Zhelezo levery. Lots of activity on the sea, Restless Wharf and the Skew councillors have spewed on folk to protests. Golden Chain has been a great help to the Zhelezo and Concord. Mal's parents put in a good word for her, so she is able to work in the Open Quay. Avelina leaves us alone, mentions she rents a room her.

As soon as the two guards who were talking about the party, we inquire about the party. In 12 days there is a party to celebrate the completion of the fortress / vault.

We meet back up with Doloris on the ship. Doloris inquires about our day. Learns that we heard about the party, opportune moment to steal the gold. Asking about how we intend to smuggle the gold, we mention that we haven't worked out that part yet. Doloris mentions she has a lead, but we have to fight the Myriad for it. 

Mentions temple can't fend for themselves, so we could help the temple by fighting off the Myriad who intend to use the routes forcefully. As the Myriad is a fierce competitor, we would be gaining a favour with the temple and fight off a competing organisation.

We get some drinks and discuss the plans for the next day.

Doloris dreams. On a derelict crumbling wooden ship. Helmed by a faceless creature in a massive black cloak. Darkness surrounds her, ambient green light coming from the bottom. Sees the familiar waters of the river Styx. A shape in the water, shroud covering face. Wet crumpled angelic wings coming out the back. Mentally hears "it is you again child". Asks if Doloris has deciphered it yet. Shape changes into a flame out of hands, with a briar crown underneath, similar to the scroll with the calendar.

It is the briar blaze heart, conjured to remain a secret. Only followers of Evandra may lay eyes upon her, decreed by their lady. Doloris asks if she is allowed to decipher it. Creature says the ones we took it from is also looking, rather has Doloris decipher it than them. Spirit starts sinking into the depths. Finally Doloris hears "briar blaze must remain intact".

Doloris wakes up. Gets out of bed, unfolds the scroll with the calendar. Takes the scroll and gets up to the deck to get some fresh air. Super foggy at this time, like the captain mentioned. Sighing not being able to peer out over the sea, she gets back to bed. Bumps into Captain Sariel on the way back. Doloris asks why the fog is here, Captain mentions that the fog comes from the waters surrounding Nicodranas. Relic from the city's trip to Avernus. Doloris goes back to bed.

We wake up and get some breakfast. Doloris asks Mal to take another look at the map. T'hau asks about Mal's name, if it's Mal or Louise. A short and awkward conversation starts over Mal's past, and it is implied that we are not to inquire any further for now.

Doloris and Mal leave the table and look at the map. Doloris mentions that it is the Briar Blaze and someone else is after it, learned from her matron. They get to work on deciphering the map. Managing to make some progress, they learn that the sky on the scroll points to  a date connected to Melora, Wild's Grandure. Equinox, 20th day of third month. Just missed that mark, as it's early spring. Looking at the sky and thinking of that day, scroll seems to point to Menagerie Coast, specifically the Lushgut Forest. Location of Melora fighting Zehir and Bane. Forest itself was a prison created by Melora to keep followers of Zehir and Bane locked in. Hundreds of Melora's followers sacrificed themselves during this battle, depicted by the hands in the symbol.

Later that morning, we head out to see Gallen Primewater in the Restless Wharf. Primewater Hall stands out about from the other buildings. Looks out over the canal and a park.

![[primewater-hall.png]]

Knock on the door, half elf opens the door. Mal asks if he is Mr Primewater. Man is Ezequiel, asks if we have an appointment. Mal says we don't and that we would like to discuss business, having goods for trade. Invites us inside and Ezequiel goes to ask if Mr Primewater has interest.

![[primewater-hall-inside.png]]

Mal says we are from the Serpent's Tide, looking for a trade. Gellan seems interested, would send one of his contacts to come by later and seal the deal. Primewater inquires why we came to him, Mal says because we heard that he is good for his people. Primewater says that the people of the Restless Wharf have had a rough time rebuilding. Finally mentions that Mr Orlen will come by to make the deal.

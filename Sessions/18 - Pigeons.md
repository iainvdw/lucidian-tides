The crew finds their way to the Cultured Corset. They discuss whether or not there’s actually a cult here, possibly wearing corsets. They order a round of the local drink called the Gentleman’s Wink and briefly talk about what just happened. Stormbreaker approaches the manager of the place, paying her forty platinum to set up a play of sorts of a cult. 
Eventually, two tieflings wearing large cloaks approach the table, taking Stormbreaker’s hand and leading him away. The others follow upon his insistence and they’re all led downstairs, where they can hear chanting. There’s candlelight illuminating six other people wearing velvet robes, standing in a circle around a hastily drawn pentagram on the floor. 

The jig is soon up as Rayna looks right through the fake ‘cult’. They head back upstairs, leave and head towards the ship to talk about everything they saw at the temple. Mal shares what she saw with her father and Doloris, Rayna describes the music box she saw and heard, as well as the de Montfort family crest. Mal thinks back if she ever noticed music boxes in her family home, recalling there was one in the smoking room. She describes it to Rayna, who does recognise it, but says her mother told her this was a one-of-a-kind box that was made by Rayna’s father. Rayna asks if this means they have the same dad, Mal saying she doesn’t think her father made anything in his life; he probably had it commissioned. She recalls her father came home with it as a present for Mal’s younger sister.  

The conversation turns to what they’ll do now. The captain suggests they upgrade the ship somewhat, which the crew gladly agrees with. He then says they need a new quartermaster. Doloris volunteers and the captain asks Stormbreaker if he wants to be the new navigator, which he agrees to. The captain then points out they’re still looking for the ‘terrorists’ from Nicodranas, and Alvaro put his lapdog, Jean-Baptiste de Cretica in charge. Stormbreaker recognises this name: he served with this man.

He shares what he knows, remarking how Jean-Baptiste had no issue shooting refugee ships. Doloris asks him about this, to which Stormbreaker explains this was the incident that made him turn against the Concord. She asks him if he knows how many families he broke apart, Stormbreaker saying he likely broke many families apart. Despite this, he apologises. Doloris says she misses her father, but she’s grateful for the new ‘family’ he pointed her to: the Revelry. Stormbreaker says he’s not sure about the Revelry, but he would consider the crew ‘home’. 

Together with the captain, the crew discusses where to go next. They decide to meet with Alkhamar the following morning, and then set out to find the heart. Doloris emphasises how important the heart is - she died when she was six, and was brought back and told specifically she was supposed to protect the Briarblaze Heart. The group talks about how that must’ve made for an interesting childhood, to which Doloris says the divine powers she was given made her a little cocky. Mal points out she wasn’t cocky and selfish enough to not rescue Mal in Avernus. They continue the discussion for a while, agreeing the heart has priority. 

Stormbreaker points out there’s something odd about Alvaro; he’s high up and in power, but is still acting somewhat above his station. They talk about why he wants the heart, Mal suggesting he could be a follower of one of the two Betrayer Gods who’s followers and relics were locked away in the Briarblaze Heart. 

After this conversation, everyone gets some rest.

The following morning, they head towards the Pearl Shrine to meet up with the Night Warden, who leads them to the Alkhamar estate. It is surrounded by high hedges, with a big fenced gate. They’re led to the back of the mansion, where there’s a small terrace and a big green house. An older white haired elf is waiting there for them. 

They tell Alkhamar about the map, eventually showing it to him and telling him where they found it. He explains there are seven maps, each detailing a different route and each accessible on different dates. The head priestess of the local temple to Avandra also had a map, for the date a week in the future. There needs to be prayers and sacrifice at these dates to keep the alter going, which considering the crew have one map and the priestess had the other, two dates will have passed without said prayer and sacrifice. 

Alkhamar says they can use the maps they have to find out who has the map with the next date. He mutters about how it used to be easier when Ukaviel did this. Doloris recognises this name as the one of her angelic guide. They were apparently the last guardian of the forest. 

Alkhamar goes on to say there’s a sequence of prayers that Avandra teaches that need to be said at the alter. The Nightwarden knows this sequence of prayers. The power of the heart will be much weakened because two dates were missed; it will not be easy to get to it. T’hau asks about the sacrifice that was mentioned: Alkhamar explains it’s nothing too gruesome, just some drops of blood from a true believer. 

Alkhamar goes on to explain how they can use the map they have to find the next map. If they hold the map up underneath moonlight and they draw a line between some of the symbols, they should be able to use that line as a compass. 

He then mentions Alvaro, saying they always thought he was behind the capturing of the priests. He suggests the group testify against Alvaro, though the crew aren’t sure what their word is gonna do against Alvaro’s. The group confers for a moment, none of them liking the idea of testifying as they’ll likely just be waved off as pirates. 

Alkhamar says that some of the other city states of the Concord may vote in their favor, but many will also side with Alvaro. Especially the Lapidus family, one of which is the current marquis of Port Damali, is on Alvaro’s side. 

They discuss how best to approach this all, Alkhamar pointing out that one of his daughters was in the Revelry and the other was in the Myriad; he thinks it’s time to bring them in on this discussion.

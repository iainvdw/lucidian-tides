T'hau can't sleep, staring over the bay. Pouring over a map and a book. Book penned down by quartermaster of a ship called The Wild Rose.

> Captain Valeria has ordered her first expedition of the Crystalfen Caverns. The strange telepathic lure that bosun Caldoun felt seemed to eminate from there, at least... according to the Thaumatic compass. I've pressed upon the captain how dangerous this might be, but she insisted we still send the dinghey out. She has decided to lead the expedition herself, so I'll take command of the Rose until she gets back.
> 
> I sure hope they can find a cause for Caldouns' catathonic state. Although I suppose it's not fully catathonic seing as he keeps repeating the word 'Salar'.

> 18 Horisal, 532 PD.
> The Wild Rose is on it's way back to Emons harbors. The crew is silent. Nobody wants to talk about what happened yesterday. Everybody on that dinghey came back different. Captain Valeria has her bright moments, as do the rest, but i've caught her many times just staring in the middle distance. Like she doesn't seem aware on what plane she is on anymore. 
> 
> I'm not sure but I think it's a condition that is worsened by Ruidus. Last night the entire dinghey crew seemed completely out of it whenever that horrible moon showed it self from behind the clouds.

> Ruidus made it worse. The Rose now lies at the bottom of Slumber Reef in dagger bay. Me and the other survivors marked it with a red buoy. For any future expedition to the wreck that hopes to find information about what happened; you will find only death.

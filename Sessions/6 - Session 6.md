We follow [[Doloris]] through the Undercellar, as we suddenly spot a dwarf and a bugbear near a door. They notice Kirour Grimblade and call out to him. [[T'hau]] grabs him and ask him to tell his friends to back off. Kirour ignores that request, seeing this as an opportunity.

Mal walks up to the dwarf and bugbear, who are quick to bar the door they are in front of. Mal shouts out she senses something fiendish nearby. The dwarf and bugbear get out their weapons and start fighting Mal.

We hear a loud scream coming from the door the bugbear is guarding.

T'hau summons their echo, moves it through the sewage of the Sluice Weave and haves it emerges near the dwarf to attack him. Mal attacks the dwarf as well and drops him. Mal then walks up to the bugbear, asking what's behind the door. He's keeping it shut for our own good. Tells us he'll talk to us if we can pass a piece of wood to bar the door down.

Doloris pushes the bugbear out of the way and opens the door. A young woman in a nightgown emerges, starts thanking us. Asks us to take her up top, pointing to the manacled feet. Tells us her name is Enna. Bugbear seems very scared of her. Enna says she has no idea what the bugbear is talking about. Doloris doesn't seem to trust Enna, seeing through her lies, telling her we might push he back inside.

Bugbear finally gives in and tells us she was staying with the Myriad, messing with their dreams. They put her away, but she escaped. Now they want to put her away for good. Mal figures Enna is a hag, manacles on her feet seem to lock her to this plane.

In a moment of lowered attention on her, Enna tries to make for it, running towards the exit past Doloris and Mal. Mal tries to trip her, but Enna dodges her. Doloris tries to knock Enna out with a boomerang. She knocks her down. Rayna ensnares them with a spell. The bugbear takes Enna back to the room and locks her up.

Kirour shouts to the bugbear that he should run, but the bugbear ignores him. Rayna asks about the fireproof parrot. Bugbear doesn't know exactly, but mentions it came from the dwarf's ring. We take the ring.

We exit through Lot 32 to a small empty cellar. There's a few wooden supports for casks, a ladder leads up to a hatch. We exit on the periphery of the Wide, drunks are brushed out of taverns and inns, as it's quite late already.

We make our way to the counting house on the docks to deliver Kirour and a barrel as proof. Zhelezo guards on the balcony notice us and approach us. We present Kirour and the barrel and make our case. Doesn't immediately take Kirour in, as they want to check our accusations. With the mention of Myriad, the guard seems very surprised. Kirour shouts that the guard should mention their name to First Sergeant Brehkan. We mention that the Myriad is in cahoots with the Golden Chain. Zhelezo guard mentions that they will try to avoid the First Sergeant.

We go to the ship, put Kirour in the brig and get some rest. Kirour is acting like a petulant child for a while, as Stormbreaker and T'hau guard Kirour.

Rayna checks the broom closet, and a single green bud is growing from the soil in one of her pots. It's a bud of a nutmeg shrub. Iggy scuttles up Rayna's shoulder, looks at her. Rayna tells it not to burn the plant. Iggy braces himself for a moment and the cracks in its obsidian body glow up, seeming to ask if this place needs more light.

Mal investigates the ring and learns that it is magic. It is tied to a fiendish patron and would need a pact for its wielder to utilise its power. Gem seems like it's worth quite a bit of money, after the magic would die down eventually.

Later during that morning, four Zhelezo show up, one wearing an officer's uniform, a woman with long red hair. Introduces herself as captain Levenia. Confirmed to us that eight casks were stolen indeed, asks us where the other casks are as we only have one. Mal says Kirour only approached us with one, but the captain doesn't seem to fully buy the story.

Mal takes the captain down to the brig, starts interrogating Kirour, and asks us about the other barrels. Stormbreaker makes up a bullshit story about us drinking seven barrels. Captain sees through our lies and Stormbreaker finally gives in and tells her that we'll deliver all the barrels. With that, she mentions there is a price of 500gp on Kirour's head. We also mention that Vidorant was named by Kirour to the officer, which seems to worry the Zhelezo quite a bit. Says Zhelezo are a bit powerless in the Undercellar.

The captain and the rest of the crew are also informed.

Stormbreaker has a moment of a flashback. 

> "Captain Alvaro!" a voice yells down from the portside windlass. "The scouts are rounding the corner!" 
> 
> Alvaro, standing next to you, doesn't flinch and remains hunched over a nautical map of the Bisaft Archipelago. 
> 
> - "I heard him." 
> 
> "Captain Alvaro!" the voice repeats, closer this time. Keeping his eyes on the nautical map, Alvaro seems to wait until he can hear the incoming footsteps.
> 
> Then, with all the regal weight that thirty years spent in the Concord Fleet gives to a man, he straightens up and turns towards the figure.
> 
> This young duty officer's brisk walk falters, coming to an abrupt halt. "Uh.. sir", as soon as he locks eyes with Alvaro, his voice falls away. 
> 
> Alvaro lets the silence hang in the air for a handful of heartbeats. "We are not in a cattle market in the Tumbledowns, leftennant Yarrik. This is the helm of a commanding frigate of the Clovis Concord. Routine information is not-simply shouted in the general direction of its intended recipient. Is that clear?"   
> 
> The young lad swallows. "Yes sir."
> 
> Alvaro locks his eyes a few seconds longer, then lowers his head in a slight nod. "Now. Report."
> 
> "Yes, sir." Yarrik swallowed again. "We've just received signals from the scouting ships, sir: the river loses any depts about a mile inland."
> 
> "Very good." Alvaro nods. "Dismissed."

Rayna wants a hole in her door to let some light in for her plants.

Mal and Doloris research the Ki'nau symbols again.

Others go to visit Gellan Primewater to sell the silk. Mentioning that we have silk to sell to Ezekiel, he'll check with Mr. Primewater. We are taken inside, past a bathhouse and a ballroom. Are taken to a semicircular office, with a view of the luxurious garden. We present the silk. Gellan is interested, but asks where we obtained it. Stormbreaker hints that we obtained it from an exotic place.

Gellan will buy the silk from us, in return for a favour. Rumours came that bones came floating up near a fishing spot, fishermen avoid this spot now. We can inform with LÃ©on & Thirellia Handasher, fishmongers on The Wide.

Gellan gives us the advice to get acquainted with Ida and the Montfort family, they get majority votes on the council.

Mal and Doloris are researching the documents again. They figure the Lushgut forest contains something very powerful. It's known for being impenetrable, very dense jungle. Some symbols on the document make very little sense to Doloris, but they seem vaguely Elvish in nature. Some elves worship Evandra, notably some pallid elves. They remember the captain is a pallid elf as well, and want to check in with him.

Captain recalls the Pallid Grove. Takes a look at the map, and tells that they are symbols for benevolent nature spirits. Child's story that they guard the most sacred places that Melora and Evandra explored together. They show the flask with the blue liquid, captain tells its Moon Oil. Captain points to a symbol on the map, a bear-like figure hanging from a branch, Zorbo. Tells that we could ask that spirit for guidance, at the ruins of Sepesca.

Obaya came by that she wanted to pray in the temple. Came to thank us from some kind of horrible destiny and not heading back to Port Zoon or Port Damali, while we figure out what's going on.

We find the fishmongers on the Wide to ask about the bones. Woman greets us. Rayna mentions Mr Primewater sent us. Woman fetches her husband. Natchuala Bay, bones drifting up, more bones, even a skull. Wind started to pick up, crazy noises, horrible wind. Strange cuts on the bones.

Discussing on the ship, we decide to sail out next day to not sleep near the haunted area.

We have dinner on the ship and then head out to the Helm & Cloak. Rayna notices two Zhelezo counting coin, laughing at a drink person at the bar, who's a bit too deep into their drink. Seeming like they are betting on that person keeping it together. Rayna approaches the two Zhelezo guards, asking if there's something less boring to do around here. Rayna asks if there are parties around here, and the Zhelezo mentions the party in about a week. Devlon at the bar has guard duty on party night as they showed up drunk to work one day.

Mal looks around if she spots Ava her friend, not noticing her in the packed crowd. From a booth Mal suddenly hears her named called out as she notices Ava sitting with a few friends. Ava seems pretty drunk, telling Mal that she finds that she needs this from time to time. Mal seems to cut through it and thinks that she is going through something. Mal asks if she wants another drink and join her a the bar. Mal orders a water for Ava instead of ale and asks her if nothing's wrong. Ava opens up and mentions that there is some trouble with the Golden Chain, a liaison by the name of Usah Ribbond. Asking about the Golden Chain, Ava tells they got involved when Nicodranas came back, few Zhelezo were left. Concord sent Golden Chain from Port Damali to guard the city until they recruited enough Zhelezo to replace them. Council and Concord want to keep Chain here. Mal's father has a big vote in that matter. Mal could convince her father to vote the Golden Chain out.

Back on the ship, Bartholomew is alone on deck, smoking a pipe, staring over the Serpent's Tide's deck and out over the sea. At the last second, they hear footsteps behind them. Turning around to face it, a sword enters their stomach, poison entering their system and taking the better of them, killing them.

When we get on deck, we see the ship is a mess. Sail is flapping in the wind, "Pirate scum" written in blood on the sail. Innards and outards of Bartholomew are spread out over the rigging on the ship.

We follow [[Doloris]] through the Undercellar, as we suddenly spot a dwarf and a bugbear near a door. They notice Kirour Grimblade and call out to him. [[T'hau]] grabs him and ask him to tell his friends to back off. Kirour ignores that request, seeing this as an opportunity.

Mal walks up to the dwarf and bugbear, who are quick to bar the door they are in front of. Mal shouts out she senses something fiendish nearby. The dwarf and bugbear get out their weapons and start fighting Mal.

We hear a loud scream coming from the door the bugbear is guarding.

T'hau summons their echo, moves it through the sewage of the Sluice Weave and haves it emerges near the dwarf to attack him. Mal attacks the dwarf as well and drops him. Mal then walks up to the bugbear, asking what's behind the door. He's keeping it shut for our own good. Tells us he'll talk to us if we can pass a piece of wood to bar the door down.

Doloris pushes the bugbear out of the way and opens the door. A young woman in a nightgown emerges, starts thanking us. Asks us to take her up top, pointing to the manacled feet. Tells us her name is Enna. Bugbear seems very scared of her. Enna says she has no idea what the bugbear is talking about. Doloris doesn't seem to trust Enna, seeing through her lies, telling her we might push he back inside.

Bugbear finally gives in and tells us she was staying with the Myriad, messing with their dreams. They put her away, but she escaped. Now they want to put her away for good. Mal figures Enna is a hag, manacles on her feet seem to lock her to this plane.

In a moment of lower attention, Enna tries to make for it, running towards the exit past Doloris and Mal. Mal tries to trip her, but Enna dodges her. Doloris tries to knock Enna out with a boomerang. She knocks her down. Rayna ensnares them with a spell. The bugbear takes Enna back to the room and locks her up.

Kirour shouts to the bugbear that he should run, but the bugbear ignores him. Rayna asks about the fireproof parrot. Bugbear doesn't know exactly, but mentions it came from the dwarf's ring. We take the ring.

We exit through Lot 32 to a small empty cellar. There's a few wooden supports for casks, a ladder leads up to a hatch. We exit on the periphery of the Wide, drunks are brushed out of taverns and inns, as it's quite late already.

We make our way to the counting house on the docks to deliver Kirour and a barrel as proof. Zhelezo guards on the balcony notice us and approach us. We present Kirour and the barrel and make our case. Doesn't immediately take Kirour in, as they want to check our accusations. With the mention of Myriad, the guard seems very surprised. Kirour shouts that the guard should mention their name to First Sergeant Brehkan. We mention that the Myriad is in cahoots with the Golden Chain. Zhelezo guard mentions that they will try to avoid the First Sergeant.

We go to the ship, put Kirour in the brig and get some rest. Kirour is acting like a petulant child for a while, as Stormbreaker and T'hau guard Kirour.

Rayna checks the broom closet, and a single green bud is growing from the soil in one of her pots. It's a bud of a nutmeg shrub. Iggy scuttles up Rayna's shoulder, looks at her. Rayna tells it not to burn the plant. Iggy braces himself for a moment and the cracks in its obsidian body glow up, seeming to ask if this place needs more light.

Mal investigates the ring and learns that it is magic. It is tied to a fiendish patron and would need a pact for its wielder to utilise its power. Gem seems like it's worth quite a bit of money, after the magic would die down eventually.

Later during that morning, four Zhelezo show up, one wearing an officer's uniform, a woman with long red hair. Introduces herself as captain Levenia. Confirmed to us that eight casks were stolen indeed, asks us where the other casks are as we only have one. Mal says Kirour only approached us with one, but the captain doesn't seem to fully buy the story.

Mal takes the captain down to the brig, starts interrogating Kirour, and asks us about the other barrels. Stormbreaker makes up a bullshit story about us drinking seven barrels. Captain sees through our lies and Stormbreaker finally gives in and tells her that we'll deliver all the barrels. With that, she mentions there is a price of 500gp on Kirour's head. We also mention that Vidorant was named by Kirour to the officer, which seems to worry the Zhelezo quite a bit. Says Zhelezo are a bit powerless in the Undercellar.

The captain and the rest of the crew are also informed.

Stormbreaker has a moment of a flashback. A voice from a young officer calls to Captain Alvaro. Captain turns to Stormbreaker, asks if they disapprove with their methods. Order and discipline are important. Captain mentio

We follow [[Doloris]] through the Undercellar, as we suddenly spot a dwarf and a bugbear near a door. They notice Kirour and call out to him. [[T'hau]] grabs him and ask him to tell his friends to back off. Kirour ignores that request, seeing this as an opportunity.

Mal walks up to the dwarf and bugbear, who are quick to bar the door they are in front of. Mal shouts out she senses something fiendish nearby. The dwarf and bugbear get out their weapons and start fighting Mal.

We hear a loud scream coming from the door the bugbear is guarding.

T'hau summons their echo, moves it through the sewage of the Sluice Weave and haves it emerges near the dwarf to attack him. Mal attacks the dwarf as well and drops him. Mal then walks up to the bugbear, asking what's behind the door. He's keeping it shut for our own good. Tells us he'll talk to us if we can pass a piece of wood to bar the door down.

Doloris pushes the bugbear out of the way and opens the door. A young woman in a nightgown emerges, starts thanking us. Asks us to take her up top, pointing to the manacled feet. Tells us her name is Enna. Bugbear seems very scared of her. Enna says she has no idea what the bugbear is talking about. Doloris doesn't seem to trust Enna, seeing through her lies, telling her we might push he back inside.

Bugbear finally gives in and tells us she was staying with the Myriad, messing with their dreams. They put her away, but she escaped. Now they want to put her away for good. Mal figures Enna is a hag, manacles on her feet seem to lock her to this plane.

In a moment of lower attention, Enna tries to make for it, running towards the exit past Doloris and Mal. Mal tries to trip her, but Enna dodges her. Doloris tries to knock Enna out with a boomerang. She knocks her down. Rayna ensnares them with a spell. The bugbear takes Enna back to the room and locks her up.

Kirour shouts to the bugbear that he should run, but the bugbear ignores him. Rayna asks about the fireproof parrot. Bugbear doesn't know exactly, but mentions it came from the dwarf's ring. We take the ring.

We exit through Lot 32 to a small empty cellar. There's a few wooden supports for casks, a ladder leads up to a hatch. We exit on the periphery of the Wide, drunks are brushed out of taverns and inns, as it's quite late already.

We make our way to the counting house on the docks to deliver Kirour and a barrel as proof. Zhelezo guards on the balcony notice us and approach us. We present Kirour and the barrel and make our case. Doesn't immediately take Kirour in, as they want to check our accusations. With the mention of Myriad, the guard seems very surprised. Kirour shouts that

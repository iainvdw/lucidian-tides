In the room connecting the Undercellar to a sea entrance, we start planning the ambush for the Myriad. To the north is a basin with its water level about 10ft below the walkway, an ideal spot to stay out of sight and ambush. 

We find some poles and planks and construct a basic raft that would hold a few of us out of sight. We lower it into the water as soon as its finished and [[Mallory Calder|Mal]], [[T'hau]] and [[Doloris]] wait on the raft.

Meanwhile, [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] turns herself into a spider and positions herself above the door where we suspect The Myriad folks would be entering from. [[Stormbreaker]] positions himself along the walkway, to meet anyone entering the room.

Some time later, we hear the sounds of rolling of barrels get louder and louder. Then, an elder and somewhat sickly looking dwarf named Kirour, and two other larger creatures enter the room. They address Stormbreaker, telling him that they haven't seen him earlier. The dwarven figure asks where [[Sister Pherria]] is who they made the deal with. A short discussion ensues about letting them pass to the sea entrance.

Stormbreaker offers a deal they can't refuse, and tells them to leave the barrels, turn away and cease Myriad activity. The dwarf laughs in his face, then asks Yaz the ogre to show Stormbreaker what they're about. The ogre starts swinging the anchor and chain from their neck. At that cue, we start attacking.

We make short work of the ogre. Kirour the dwarf attacks Rayna.

Mr Ribbons rules the Undercellar. All but sanctioned by The Golden Chain, Vidorant himself. Work with the crew of The Sea Ghost, supposed to deliver cargo to them through the smuggling route. Sent a sloop to platform up the tunnel.

We search Kirour, find he has a piece of parchment on him, seems to be a signalling system, but it's written in Dwarvish. Mal fetches [[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]] for translating, comes back a bit later. 

Bartholomew translates it into a list of signals:

>Long–short–short–short: “Is it safe?”
>Short–long–short–long: “Everything safe.” 
>Long–long–long: “Ready to unload; come with the ship"

Kirour wears a nice piece of magical leather armour, intricate dwarven symbols embossed on it. Yaz has a bullhorn lantern for signalling ships.

We discuss what to do with Kirour and how to get him out of the Undercellar. We plan to take Kirour to the Zhelezo, the Counting House near the docks.

We leave for lot 32, traversing the maze of the Undercellar. Doloris is leading us out of here, but as we do, we spot glowing eyes in a corner, and a few of them calling out "Kirour".

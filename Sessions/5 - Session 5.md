We plan the ambush for the Myriad.

We build a raft in the basin, Rayna turns into a spider, Stormbreaker waits near a railing.

A dwarf and two other larger creatures enter the room. Address Stormbreaker that they haven't seen him earlier. Asks where [[Sister Pherria]] is who they made the deal with. A short discussion ensues. Stormbreaker tries to make a deal they can't refuse, to asks to leave the barrels, turn away and cease Myriad activity. Dwarf laughs and asks Yaz the ogre to show Stormbreaker what they're about.

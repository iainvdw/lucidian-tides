In the room connecting the Undercellar to a sea entrance, we start planning the ambush for the Myriad. To the north is a basin with its water level about 10ft below the walkway, an ideal spot to stay out of sight and ambush. 

We find some poles and planks and construct a basic raft that would hold a few of us out of sight. We lower it into the water as soon as its finished and [[Mallory Calder|Mal]], [[T'hau]] and [[Doloris]] wait on the raft.

Meanwhile, [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] turns herself into a spider and positions herself above the door where we suspect The Myriad folks would be entering from. [[Stormbreaker]] positions himself along the walkway, to meet anyone entering the room.

Some time later, we hear the sounds of rolling of barrels get louder and louder. Then, an elder and somewhat sickly looking dwarf named [[Kirour]] enters the room, together with an ogre called Yaz and a strange creature with crystal-like scales called Ocremoch. They address Stormbreaker, telling him that they haven't seen him earlier and he's in their way. Kirour asks where [[Sister Pherria]] is who they made the deal with. A short discussion ensues about letting them pass to the sea entrance.

[[Stormbreaker]] offers a deal they can't refuse, and tells them to leave the barrels, turn away and cease [[Myriad]] activity. Kirour laughs at this offer, and then asks Yaz the ogre to show Stormbreaker what they're about. Yaz grabs the large anchor and chain around his neck, and starts swinging it at Stormbreaker.

As soon as we hear the combat start, we trigger the ambush and jump up on the walkway from our raft. We make short work of Yaz and Ocremoch. Seeing the odds turn against him, Kirour tries to make a break for it, turning invisible and running towards the door. T'hau manages to intercept him using their echo teleportation, blocking the door.

We manage to capture Kirour and start interrogating him. We learn that Heltur Ribbond, also known as Mr Ribbons, runs the Undercellar. The Myriad activity here is all but sanctioned by [[Golden Chain|The Golden Chain]], namely [[Commander Da'urlo Vidorant|Vidorant]] himself. They were supposed to deliver the cargo they were carrying to the crew of The Sea Ghost. The ship would have sent a sloop to platform up the tunnel.

The cargo
150gp per bale of silk, 3 bales
50gp per barrel, 8 barrels

We search Kirour, find he has a piece of parchment on him, seems to be a signalling system, but it's written in Dwarvish. Mal fetches [[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]] for translating, comes back a bit later. 

Bartholomew translates it into a list of signals:

>Long–short–short–short: “Is it safe?”
>Short–long–short–long: “Everything safe.” 
>Long–long–long: “Ready to unload; come with the ship"

Kirour wears a nice piece of magical leather armour, intricate dwarven symbols embossed on it. Yaz has a bullhorn lantern for signalling ships.

We discuss what to do with Kirour and how to get him out of the Undercellar. We plan to take Kirour to the Zhelezo, the Counting House near the docks.

We leave for lot 32, traversing the maze of the Undercellar. Doloris is leading us out of here, but as we do, we spot glowing eyes in a corner, and a few of them calling out "Kirour".

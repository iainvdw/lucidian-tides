We plan the ambush for the Myriad.

We build a raft in the basin, Rayna turns into a spider, Stormbreaker waits near a railing.

A dwarf and two other larger creatures enter the room. Address Stormbreaker that they haven't seen him earlier. Asks where [[Sister Pherria]] is who they made the deal with. A short discussion ensues. Stormbreaker tries to make a deal they can't refuse, to asks to leave the barrels, turn away and cease Myriad activity. Dwarf laughs and asks Yaz the ogre to show Stormbreaker what they're about. Ogre starts swinging the anchor and chain from their neck. At that cue, we start attacking.

We make short work of the ogre. Kirour the dwarf attacks Rayna.

Mr Ribbons rules the Undercellar. All but sanctioned by The Golden Chain, Vidorant himself. Work with the crew of The Sea Ghost, supposed to deliver cargo to them through the smuggling route. Sent a sloop to platform up the tunnel.

150gp per bale of silk, 3 bales
50gp per barrel, 8 barrels

We search Kirour, find he has a piece of parchment on him, seems to be a signalling system, but it's written in Dwarvish. Mal fetches [[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]] for translating, comes back a bit later. 

Bartholomew translates it into a list of signals:

>Long–short–short–short: “Is it safe?”
>Short–long–short–long: “Everything safe.” 
>Long–long–long: “Ready to unload; come with the ship"

Kirour wears a nice piece of magical leather armour, intricate dwarven symbols embossed on it. Yaz has a bullhorn lantern for signalling ships.

We discuss what to do with Kirour and how to get him out of the Undercellar. We plan to take Kirour to the Zhelezo, the Counting House near the docks.

We leave for lot 32, traversing the maze of the Undercellar. Doloris is leading us out of here, but as we do, we spot glowing eyes in a corner, and a few of them calling out "Kirour".

We plan the ambush for the Myriad.

We build a raft in the basin, Rayna turns into a spider, Stormbreaker waits near a railing.

A dwarf and two other larger creatures enter the room. Address Stormbreaker that they haven't seen him earlier. Asks where [[Sister Pherria]] is who they made the deal with. A short discussion ensues. Stormbreaker tries to make a deal they can't refuse, to asks to leave the barrels, turn away and cease Myriad activity. Dwarf laughs and asks Yaz the ogre to show Stormbreaker what they're about. Ogre starts swinging the anchor and chain from their neck. At that cue, we start attacking.

We make short work of the ogre. Kirour the dwarf attacks Rayna.

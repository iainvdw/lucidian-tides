Yucalia lays out the current situation and options they have. She mentions Nicodranas, which is protected by the Blood Sails, who are former Revelry pirates who can be bought. Another option they have is to head to [[Brokenbank]], to see if they can get Brokenbank on their side. Reclaiming Port Damali would likely aid in getting Brokenbank (and the civil government of the Concord) on their side. A discussion erupts amongst the pirates present. 

The crew discusses what they think might be bad and are joined in their discussion by Captain Thalios Dondarion. He has an alternative suggestion: bribe the dragon turtle that protects the islands into helping them attack the navy. Captains Sadie and Entropy join the discussion as well, seemingly agreeing with what they’re talking about. 

Some others seem to be in favor of a full on assault on Nicodranas, whereas a third group that seems to form led by Firetalon and Captain Gorehorn Blackhoof, doesn’t want to focus the money or attention on the Menagerie Coast at all, but instead wants to split it amongst the crews. 

The group in favor of Brokenbank are discussing heading to Marquet, the name Kuliq Yhom coming up repeatedly. Doloris overhears Firetalon and Blackhoof talk about a magical conch. 

The crew agrees on somewhat of a plan: attack the navy by sea whilst they sneak on land and try to fuel the rebellion, hoping to get to Alvaro and capture him alive so he can be put on trial. Storm and Lou approach Th’willian and Llaskalar to present their plan, hoping to convince them to their side. 

Discussions conclude as they try to catch the Plank Queen’s attention. They present the plan to her and most of the pirates seem to agree it’s a good plan. Blackhoof is the only one who objects, convinced they as pirates should stay out of such politics, but he and Firetalon are the only ones who think this way. The majority votes go to the plan to attack Nicodranas. 

The Plank Queen concludes the conclave, saying she’ll want to meet with smaller groups later so they can decide which group of pirates will do what. 

As they’ve been dismissed for the moment, the crew head to the Keel Hall to get some drinks. Lou brings up [[Heddic Rollins|Heddic]], unsure if talking to her family’s head navigator may get the crew information they need. They’re unsure if it will be of any use to speak to him. 

The discussion turns to how to turn the people of Nicodranas against Alvaro, which leads to them exposing Lou’s dad as well. Rayna suggests the music boxes may be an angle, as they may be able to open a portal to Hell with it. 

Lou takes a look at the music box, recognising the obelisk that appeared in her father’s music box as well. She recognises abjuration and conjuration magic from the magical infernal runes coming from the music box. Seems like it’s keeping something locked inside.
She notes the number six, likely referring to the sixth layer of Hell, Malbolge. 

Though this is interesting, it doesn’t seem to help when it comes to wanting to expose Lou’s father. Eda points out that they don’t know if this music box, which was found on a de Montfort ship, was being shipped somewhere, or if this was heading back towards Nicodranas. 

They decide to see if Heddic can’t tell them this, catching T’hau outside in a discussion with Captain Entropy. They seem to be talking about the book of Valeria, the tiefling wants to have a look at it himself. T’hau says he’ll join the others at Firetalon’s ship in a moment.
The others head towards the docks, where the find the Blind Sphinx is getting ready to leave. They approach Wave on Shore, asking for his help in getting to talk to Heddic Rollins. They speak to him and Lone Dagger, who says they’ll have to talk to Golden Chalk. Stormbreaker is allowed on board to parlay. 

Golden Chalk suggests they can buy the hostage off them, they ask for 8000 gold. The others think this is too steep, so Storm returns with an offer of 5000 instead. They eventually agree to 5000 gold, but Storm has to hand it to the captain publicly, in the same pouch they stole from Firetalon the day before. 

Storm tentatively agrees, but points out he wants to confer with T’hau first before making this decision final. They agree to return with an answer later, but before they leave, they ask to ‘inspect the goods’, aka get a quick chat with Heddic. 

As they’re heading down into the ship, Storm and Rayna keep an ear out for a potential destination of the Blind Sphinx. The crew seems slightly annoyed, mentioning winter’s clothing, two crew members mentioning the Stormcrest Mountains. 
Two cells below deck are occupied, one by a mangled tabaxi and the other by the tiefling they’re looking for, Heddic Rollins. He’s studying a medallion around his neck. 

The ship came from Marquet, heading to Nicodranas. They sailed all the way around Marquet, to the Kanak Gulf. [[Heddic Rollins|Heddic]] claims to know a little of the backdoor dealings of the de Montfort family, and also recognizes the music box. This seems to be what he picked up from the Kanak Gulf. He warned the crew of the Blind Sphinx not to take the music box. He seems to know what’s in it, but he won’t tell. He does promise Lou that, if they get him out of here and to the Menagerie Coast, he may tell her what the music box is and what’s in it.

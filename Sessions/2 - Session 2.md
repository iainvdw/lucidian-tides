[[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]] opens all cells of the ship and frees all the remaining prisoners. More Revelry pirates come out of the cells. An orc by the name of Mr. Donahue is among them, says he was Mr. Higgins' first mate and was captured during the ambush that destroyed the ship and killed Mr. Higgins. Mr. Donahue says these pirates are what remain of Higgins' crew.

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] and [[T'hau]] round up all [[Zhelezo]] and the [[Clovis Concord]] commander in one of the opened cells and relieve them of their weapons.

[[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] and [[Doloris]] scout the deck we are on, and find the galley of the ship. There they find a chef and an assistant. Chef is panicking and cries out that he is willing to defend himself, holding a knife in a threatening way. [[Obaya]] the priestess comes out of her room and walks toward the kitchen and calms the chef down, who she calls Lorenzo. As Obaya walks by Doloris, there is a brief moment of recognition between Obaya and [[Doloris]] as Obaya sees the holy symbol of the Wildmother on Doloris' armour. Obaya speaks to the chef and manages to calm him down. Lorenzo the cook drops the knife, but isn't entirely calm yet.

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] and [[Doloris]] ask Higgins' crew about the defector. Mr. Donahue mentions that the Zhelezo put him in a repurposed toilet, and points to a room on the other side of this deck.

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] and [[T'hau]] open the toilet and find an unusually large man with their arms and legs in chains. [[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]] starts working on the manacles around his ankles, and T'hau picks them up to reach the manacles up high around his wrists. 

As soon as he is freed, he wants to find the commander and ask about someone called Sheila. Walking over to the cells where the Zhelezo are locked up, the freed prisoner demands that they tell him what they did to Sheila. The commander wakes up and sees the large man angrily talking to him. The commander points to a door leading to the armoury, and the man walks off to investigate. Rummaging through a few crates, he finally emerges with a large maul in his hands, revealing that Sheila isn't a someone, it's their maul. He introduces himself as [[Stormbrea]]

[[Doloris]] speaks to [[Obaya]], Obaya was invited to head to [[Port Damali]]. Obaya doesn't really know what the invitation is about, but she is a bit curious to find out why. Invited by the Grand Admiral. She tells Doloris that if someone gets an invitation from the [[Clovis Concord]], you don't usually ignore it.

[[Doloris]] spots Lorenzo still acting a bit strangely, packing something up with his back turned to us, so we can't see what. Obaya says she doesn't really know the cook herself, but he was better company than some of the Zhelezo. Obaya asks if the ship still goes to [[Port Damali]], but Doloris denies that. Obaya asks if we are willing to drop her off in Port Zoon, or if she is property of [[The Revelry]] now. We tell her she isn't anyone's property, as [[The Revelry]] doesn't operate that way, contrary to some rumours that the [[Clovis Concord]] might have spread

We take her upstairs to [[Captain Cassian Sariel de Rochefort|Captain Sariel]] to ask what we should do with her. Eventually we decide it's best if we take her to [[Nicodranas]], as [[Port Zoon]] has a high Concord activity and is a bit of a detour for us.

As gather on the upper deck, we spot that Lorenzo is trying to sneak by us carrying a small ornate box under his arms. Lorenzo beats around the question what the box contains or who it is for, so we demand it off of him to investigate. [[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]] starts working the lock on the box but has a bit of trouble with it. After a few attempts he manages to unlock it, but by doing so, he triggers a magical trap. Suddenly, Bartholomew is attacked by a large blue magical hand. A short fight ensues where we defeat the hand and it dissipates in a fizzle of arcane energy.

Inspecting the box, we find it contains a vial with a blue liquid, which has a necklace tied to the stopper. A note lies next to the box. [[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]] opens the note and finds some magical markings, symbols and runes on the note. [[Doloris]] and [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] both seem to recognise some of the symbols. Doloris notes that the symbols relate to the Wildmother, but also sees symbols of the moon which are tied to Avandra the Changebringer. [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] notes that a symbol of fire in the middle with thorny branches might be related to the Ki'Nau. 

Questioning Lorenzo about the box and its contents, he eventually tells he is the son of the marquis of Port Zoon. Says he can't tell who he is supposed to delivering the box to. We decide to take the box with us and send Lorenzo on to Port Damali with the remaining Zhelezo with empty hands. They will have to row the rest of the way in a few dinghies.

Back on [[The Serpent's Tide]], [[Captain Cassian Sariel de Rochefort|Captain Sariel]] asks for Stormbreaker to come into their cabin. Captain asks about their involvement in the Concord, why the defected. Stormbreaker tells it might feel a bit like a trap. Otherwise, Stormbreaker isn't sure what information might help. Captain tells that our main mission is to keep Nicodranas open to Revelry business. Anything that Stormbreaker knows that might help, would be welcome. Stormbreaker tells they're building a few new ships, because of the Revelry. Might be warships, designed to fight. Implies the high taxes are being used to fund the construction of the ships. Captain mentions that the taxes the Revelry takes isn't being used at least for funding endeavours that the people don't believe in, in contrary to the Concord.

On the way to Nicodranas, Mal and Doloris work together on the scroll to try and decipher. They start to understand that it's both a calendar and a map, depicting the stars and passage of a moon. Pointing to a location where the sky is at a certain point in a certain time. Vial has something to do with it, but not sure what yet. Some divination magic, appears not to be for drinking.

Rayna asks Bartholomew for a room to do some gardening. Bartholomew suggests the room where we keep the cannon balls and black powder, but T'hau isn't too keen on letting a fire genasi with a flammable gecko on their should near the powder room.

Thau's dream:
- they're sinking
- spot female face in the moonlight in the water
- tries to swim towards me, but not fast enough, she grows smaller as she fades in the distance
- lose her eventually
- last thing I hear is a scream
- vision stays black for, minutes, hours, days
- remember the face was important, but not who

Doloris spots sails on the horizon, a merchant ship. Ship looks like it's made in Marquet, tri-point sails, fairly big. It's not up to full capacity, but that's not very unusual, as ships tend to sometimes visit multiple ports to find cargo to sell back at home.

We discuss among ourselves and decide to go after the vessel and see if we can loot some additional cargo. Mal tries to signal the ship that we need help, but it seems they don't believe us and tack away. We ready ourselves for pursuit. Manoeuvering besides the ship, we fire the cannons to the waterline, as suggested by Bartholomew. Rayna tries to burn the sails again, and a sail catches fire.

We don't spot any cannons, but there are three large ballista. Two of them fire at us, hitting our hull from the side.

A second salvo of shots causes the merchant's ship's rudder to be shot to pieces, disabling the manoeuverability of the ship. The captain of the ship calls for the crew to halt the ship and we eventually board the ship. We spot the ship's name is The Golden Dawn. Captain asks for the crew to remain unharmed. Checking the cargo, we find:
- 2 bags of Marquesian spices, worth 500gp
- Huge palm leaves that could be used to extract oil, worth 500gp

We decide to only take the spices and leave the palm leaves for the merchant ship.

Stormbreaker reveals after the battle that he was reprimanded because he didn't fire at an unarmed vessel, refusing orders to sink a ship and kill everyone on it. He seems doubtful at our motives. Captain chimes in and tells that Stormbreaker revealed that there is a vault containing a massive load of gold intended for the construction of a warfleet.

After two more days, we sail into Nicodranas' port, specifically the Restless Wharf. Dockmaster Ironbeard meets us on deck, looking to inspect our cargo. Looks closely at the forged documents, but deems them fine. Names a few options to sell the cargo to.

We spot a poster mentioning Tamulia, performing at an inn.

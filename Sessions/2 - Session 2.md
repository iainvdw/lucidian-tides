[[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]] opens all cells, frees all prisoners. An orc is freed as well by the name of Mr. Donahue, Mr. Higgins' first mate.

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] and [[T'hau]] round up all [[Zhelezo]] in one of the opened cells.

[[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] and [[Doloris]] scout the deck, find the kitchen where a chef and an assistant are. Chef is scared and cries out that he is willing to defend himself. Obaya the priestess comes out of her room and walks toward the kitchen and calms the chef down, who she calls Lorenzo.

There's a brief moment of recognition between Obaya and [[Doloris]] as she sees the holy symbol of the Wildmother.

Cook drops the knife, but isn't really calm yet.

Mal and Doloris ask Higgins' crew about the defector. Mentions a repurposed toilet and points to it.

Mal and I open the toilet and find a large man in chains. Bartholomew frees them, T'hau picks them up to reach the higher manacles. Wants to find the commander and ask about someone called Sheila. Commander wakes up and sees this large man talking to him. Points to the armoury, and the man walks over there. Rummaging through a few crates, he finally emerges with a large maul in his hands. Sheila isn't a someone, it's the maul.

Doloris speaks to Obaya, Obaya was invited to head to Port Damali. Obaya doesn't really know what the invitation is about, but she is a bit curious to find out why. Invited by Grand Admiral. Tells Doloris that if someone gets in invitation from the [[Clovis Concord]], you don't ignore it.

Doloris spots the cook acting a bit strangely, positioning himself between Doloris and Obaya and something he is packing up. Obaya says she doesn't really know the cook herself, but he was better company than some of the Zhelezo. Obaya asks if the ship still goes to Port Damali, but Doloris denies that. Obaya asks if we are willing to drop her off in Port Zoon, or if she is property of [[The Revelry]] now.

[[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]] opens all cells, frees all prisoners. An orc is freed as well by the name of Mr. Donahue, Mr. Higgins' first mate.

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] and [[T'hau]] round up all [[Zhelezo]] in one of the opened cells.

[[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] and [[Doloris]] scout the deck, find the kitchen where a chef and an assistant are. Chef is scared and cries out that he is willing to defend himself. Obaya the priestess comes out of her room and walks toward the kitchen and calms the chef down, who she calls Lorenzo.

There's a brief moment of recognition between Obaya and [[Doloris]] as she sees the holy symbol of the Wildmother.

Cook drops the knife, but isn't really calm yet.

Mal and Doloris ask Higgins' crew about the defector. Mentions a repurposed toilet and points to it.

Mal and I open the toilet and find a large man in chains. Bartholomew frees them, T'hau picks them up to reach the higher manacles. Wants to find the commander and ask about someone called Sheila. Commander wakes up and sees this large man talking to him. Points to the armoury, and the man walks over there. Rummaging through a few crates, he finally emerges with a large maul in his hands. Sheila isn't a someone, it's the maul.

Doloris speaks to Obaya, Obaya was invited to head to Port Damali. Obaya doesn't really know what the invitation is about, but she is a bit curious to find out why. Invited by Grand Admiral. Tells Doloris that if someone gets in invitation from the [[Clovis Concord]], you don't ignore it.

Doloris spots the cook acting a bit strangely, positioning himself between Doloris and Obaya and something he is packing up. Obaya says she doesn't really know the cook herself, but he was better company than some of the Zhelezo. Obaya asks if the ship still goes to Port Damali, but Doloris denies that. Obaya asks if we are willing to drop her off in Port Zoon, or if she is property of [[The Revelry]] now.

We take her upstairs to the captain to ask what we should do with her. Eventually we decide it's best if we take her to Nicodranas, as Port Zoon has a high Concord activity.

Box contains a vial with a blue liquid, has a necklace tied to the stopper. A note lies next to the box. Bartholomew opens the note and finds some magical markings, symbols and runes on it. Contains celestial symbols. [[Doloris]] and [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] both seem to recognize something. Doloris notes that the symbols relate to the WildMother, but also sees symbols of the Moon from Avandra. [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] notes that a symbol of fire in the middle with thorny branches might be related to the Ki'Nau. 

Chef tells he is the son of the marquis of Port Zoon, can't tell who he is supposed to delivering the box to. We decide to take the box with us and send Lorenzo on to Port Damali with empty hands.

Back on [[2. Locations/Darktow Isle/The Serpent's Tide]], the captain asks for Stormbreaker to come into their cabin. Captain asks about their involvement in the Concord, why the defected. Stormbreaker tells it might feel a bit like a trap. Otherwise, Stormbreaker isn't sure what information might help. Captain tells that our main mission is to keep Nicodranas open to Revelry business. Anything that Stormbreaker knows that might help, would be welcome. Stormbreaker tells they're building a few new ships, because of the Revelry. Might be warships, designed to fight. Implies the high taxes are being used to fund the construction of the ships. Captain mentions that the taxes the Revelry takes isn't being used at least for funding endeavours that the people don't believe in, in contrary to the Concord.

On the way to Nicodranas, Mal and Doloris work together on the scroll to try and decipher. They start to understand that it's both a calendar and a map, depicting the stars and passage of a moon. Pointing to a location where the sky is at a certain point in a certain time. Vial has something to do with it, but not sure what yet. Some divination magic, appears not to be for drinking.

Rayna asks Bartholomew for a room to do some gardening. Bartholomew suggests the room where we keep the cannon balls and black powder, but T'hau isn't too keen on letting a fire genasi with a flammable gecko on their should near the barrels.

Thau's dream:
- they're sinking
- spot female face in the moonlight in the water
- tries to swim towards me, but not fast enough, she grows smaller as she fades in the distance
- lose her eventually
- last thing I hear is a scream
- vision stays black for, minutes, hours, days
- remember the face was important, but not who

Doloris spots sails on the horizon, a merchant ship. Ship looks like it's made in Marquet, tri-point sails, fairly big. It's not up to full capacity, but that's not very unusual, as ships tend to sometimes visit multiple ports to find cargo to sell back at home.

We discuss among ourselves and decide to go after the vessel and see if we can loot some additional cargo. Mal tries to signal the ship that we need help, but it seems they don't believe us and tack away. We ready ourselves for pursuit. Manoeuvering besides the ship, we fire the cannons to the waterline, as suggested by Bartholomew. Rayna tries to burn the sails again, and a sail catches fire.

We don't spot any cannons, but there are three large ballista. Two of them fire at us, hitting our hull from the side.

A second salvo of shots causes the merchant's ship's rudder to be shot to pieces, disabling the manoeuverability of the ship. The captain of the ship calls for the crew to halt the ship and we eventually board the ship. We spot the ship's name is The Golden Dawn. Captain asks for the crew to remain unharmed. Checking the cargo, we find:
- 2 bags of Marquesian spices, worth 500gp
- Huge palm leaves that could be used to extract oil, worth 500gp

We decide to only take the spices and leave the palm leaves for the merchant ship.

Stormbreaker reveals after the battle that he was reprimanded because he didn't fire at an unarmed vessel, refusing orders to sink a ship and kill everyone on it. He seems doubtful at our motives. Captain chimes in and tells that Stormbreaker revealed that there is a vault containing a massive load of gold intended for the construction of a warfleet.

After two more days, we sail into Nicodranas' port, specifically the Restless Wharf. Dockmaster Ironbeard meets us on deck, looking to inspect our cargo. Looks closely at the forged documents, but deems them fine. Names a few options to sell the cargo to.

We spot a poster mentioning Tamulia, performing at an inn.

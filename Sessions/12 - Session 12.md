We stay at Kaya's, a neat looking inn with a colourful exterior.

Doloris and Stormbreaker follow one of the armored transports, and track them down to a halfling family Nathar, Whitecliffs, runs an armored transport business. Frequent at a wine bar.

Stormbreaker visits the wine bar, trying to make conversation with the clientele to find out more about the transports, informing about how they operate when transporting precious metals. Owner shows armored carriage with a solid steel bottom. They transport around 20,000 gold each month to the shipyard, chests aren't big enough to contain gold.

Mal and T'hau scout the cliff, buy some extra climbing gear. Cliff is not that hard to climb, and we manage to attach some pitons and ropes to the cliff. Mal notices a bell being rung for the change of the guard. Small window near kitchen is high and flat window, that we might be able to get inside of.

Peering in through the cell window, Mal notices a figure sitting in the cell that she recognizes. Tamulia is imprisoned in the cell.

T'hau reaches out telepathically. Tamulia was arrested because of suspected cooperation with pirates. Hearing next morning, might be transported to another prison, prison colony off the coast of Port Zoon, Repent Rock. Fortuitous Serenade, another pirate crew, the dragonfly.

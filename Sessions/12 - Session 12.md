A few days pass and with the ship gone on its mission to aid Primewater, the crew found a place to stay at Kaya’s House of Repose. During these days, the crew prepares for their upcoming heist. 

They find out that the armored transports is a service provided by a halfling family from the White Cliffs area. The Golden Chain always guards these transports themselves, but the cart and horses are provided by this halfling family. It’s the Neithar family. 

Stormbreaker speaks to Jezzlin Neithar about the transportation business, the halfling showing him one of the carriages they use. He mentions all the platinum they transport for the Golden Chain. Jezzlin also shares they transport about 20 000 gold each month.

Mal and T’hau climb up to the Golden Chain building to scout ahead, bringing some pitons to make the climb easier for themselves and the rest the day of the heist. During this scouting, they note when the guard shift takes place. Mal also notes that the small window near the storage may be a good entree point. She also notices Temulia in one of the cells. 
T’hau speaks to her telepathically. She got pinched by the Golden Chain, they believe she was working with pirates. She has a meeting with the magister the following morning, which is when she hopes to plead her case. She doesn’t know who told on her. They speak of where Temulia may be moved to if she’s found guilty - Repent Rock, a prison island outside of Port Zoon. Temulia mentions that there’s more Revelry in town, the crew of the Dragonfly. 

After discussing the plan, the crew head towards the docks to see if they can speak to the crew of the Dragonfly. As they pass the harbor, they note two man’o’war ships, one of them is Alvaro’s flagship, the Adjudicator. 

They find their way to the Fortuitous Serenade. Doloris recalls having met the Dragonfly crew before. One of the masts of the ships is a treant. The ship is captained by a wood elf named Thw'yllian. She spots a dryad making their way through the crowds, who Doloris thinks is Thw'yllian’s quartermaster. They follow the dryad through to a separate area, where they find the Dragonfly crew. 

Doloris does the talking, warning Thw'yllian that the ‘dancer’ is locked up. She introduces herself and the others as the crew of the Serpent’s Tide. Thw'yllian suggests they meet on his ship where they can talk in private. 

Thw’yllian shares they were sent here to deal with the problems with the Blushing Mermaid and a captured crew. They share some of their plan with the captain, asking if he could be an escape should they need one. They agree he and his ship shouldn’t be in the harbor when the heist goes down, as to not arouse any suspicion against him and his crew. He suggests he move his ship to outside of town and then can bring the haul to him. They discuss freeing Temulia as well, asking him to take some of the money, as well as Temulia, to Darktow. Thw'yllian suggests they meet up at Natchuala Bay. They agree to the plan, shaking on it. 

The following night, they set the plan in motion, scaling the cliffside and making their way up to the building. Doloris notes a strange shimmer on the wall leading into the storage area, pointing this out to the others. They struggle their way up, two guards atop the roof noting their approach. They manage to kill one of the guards, letting the second go after he surrenders himself. 

Rayna takes a look at the wall, also deducing it’s shimmering. She sticks a hand through; it’s an illusion. They walk through the wall and inside. They move through the building, Mal picking up on a conversation between two guards. One of the voices is Ava’s. 

They trail them through the building, eventually overhearing raised voices. The raised voices seem aimed at Ava, which is enough to prompt Mal to rush in, finding Ava being threatened by Yuzza Ribbond. He questions Mal, then puts his sword to Ava’s throat. Mal casually points out to the rest of the crew that this is the brother of the man who killed their quartermaster, which Ava uses as a distraction to push herself a little away, signalling the beginning of combat.

They defeat Yuzza, Rayna getting the final blow with her thorn whip. Mal talks to Ava, who is upset by what just happened. Though Mal told her not to investigate Ribbond, Ava did anyway and when they started asking for volunteers to guard the vault, she volunteered as it offered her the opportunity to shadow Ribbond. 

Mal tells her that they’re here to ‘do crime’, suggesting that Ava step aside and promising they will be as quiet and quick as possible. Ava, though clearly still shaken, shares that the guards have been speaking the word ‘quixotic’ as they enter the library.

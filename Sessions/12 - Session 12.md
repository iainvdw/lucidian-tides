We stay at Kaya's House of Repose, a neat looking inn with a colourful exterior.

Doloris and Stormbreaker follow one of the armored transports, and track them down to a halfling family Nathar, Whitecliffs, runs an armored transport business. Frequent at a wine bar.

Stormbreaker visits the wine bar, trying to make conversation with the clientele to find out more about the transports, informing about how they operate when transporting precious metals. Owner shows armored carriage with a solid steel bottom. They transport around 20,000 gold each month to the shipyard, chests aren't big enough to contain gold.

Mal and T'hau scout the cliff, buy some extra climbing gear. Cliff is not that hard to climb, and we manage to attach some pitons and ropes to the cliff. Mal notices a bell being rung for the change of the guard. Small window near kitchen is high and flat window, that we might be able to get inside of.

Peering in through the cell window, Mal notices a figure sitting in the cell that she recognises. Tamulia is imprisoned in the cell.

T'hau reaches out telepathically. Tamulia was arrested because of suspected cooperation with pirates. Hearing next morning, might be transported to another prison, prison colony off the coast of Port Zoon, Repent Rock. Fortuitous Serenade, another pirate crew, The Dragonfly.

Walking back to the docks, two new ships have entered the harbour. Large ships, Man o' Wars. Stormbreaker recognises Alvaro's flagship, The Adjudicator. Ships are in deep water, too massive to dock at the piers.

We get to the Fortuitous Serenade, quite a lot of people inside. On the stage reads a message that Tamulia's show is postponed. Doloris knows the crew of The Dragonfly, special ship as one of its masts is a treant, captained by a wood elf named Thuillian. Looking around the tavern, Doloris doesn't spot the crew. However, she does spot a dryad carrying a few mugs of ale. She remembers that Thuillian has a dryad as a quartermaster and we follow after the dryad.

Entering the nook, we see four figures, one of which is [[Captain Thuillian]]. Dryad, and two other elves, one male and one female. Doloris engages conversation, introducing herself as a fellow Revelry member. Captain says this isn't really the place to discuss pirat business, so they suggest to meet up on the ship.

Some time later, we meet up on the ship and the captain takes us to his quarters. Doloris asks what their business is in Nicodranas. They're here to check up on a crew that had been captured and freed.

We inform the captain of our plans and he seems very interested. We agree on a location where are to meet up, [[Natchuala Bay]]. There we will hand off the gold and the captain will sail on to Darktow, keeping a portion for themselves for the trouble.

We gather at the foot of the cliff and have trouble climbing up.

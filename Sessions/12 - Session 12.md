We stay at Kaya's, a neat looking inn with a colourful exterior.

Doloris and Stormbreaker follow one of the armored transports, and track them down to a halfling family Nathar, Whitecliffs, runs an armored transport business. Frequent at a wine bar.

Stormbreaker visits the wine bar, trying to make conversation with the clientele to find out more about the transports, informing about how they operate when transporting precious metals. Owner shows armored carriage with a solid steel bottom.

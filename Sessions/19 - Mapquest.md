Before Alkhamar’s daughters arrive, the captain suggests he head into town to look into upgrading the ship. He asks Rayna and Mal to accompany him, and the three of them leave.
Stormbreaker, Doloris and T’hau are soon introduced to Alkhamar’s daughters: red-headed twins by the names of Isol and Sarya. Isol has links to both the Cobalt Soul and the Revelry, whereas Sarya is a former member of the Myriad. Isol shares that the Cobalt Soul is looking into Alvaro as well, as his actions in Nicodranas are out of line. She also shares a letter she found, explaining that Fabrym, a member of the Enchanted Gale working for Alvaro, makes use of the teleportation circle that can be found at the Cobalt Reserve here in Port Damali.
The letter is from Alvaro’s spymaster, Navarr, and it speaks of their plan to try and get to the heart. Some of the names are familiar to the group, as well as to the twins, but some names aren’t. The name that stands out is Portentia.

Alkhamar then draws on the map that the group have, tracing some seemingly meaningless symbols that soon light up, making a magical compass appear in the air. It points west.

Isol and Sarya join as Stormbreaker, Doloris and T’hau decide to follow the compass, which eventually leads them to the Boulder Keep. There’s a secluded bit of harbour near it, inside which a ship is being loaded. Isol and Stormbreaker realize that what’s being loaded onto the ship are coffins, Stormbreaker deducing that they do seem to contain bodies. 
As the group discusses what to do about this ship, which is also where the compass is clearly pointing, Isol and Stormbreaker spot a familiar face: Joslyn. Stormbreaker recognises her as she was the one who served them all drinks when they were at the Alkhamar estate, Isol recognising her as one of her father’s wait staff as well.

Stormbreaker issues a challenge, asking Isol how fast she is, and the two of them rush off to catch Joslyn. Isol wins, scaling some walls and jumping down in front of Joslyn, who seems instantly flustered.

The rest of the group catches up, asking Joslyn some questions, who is quick to admit that she was hired by a wealthy lady named Portentia, who asks her about Alkhamar and his dealings. She further admits that she and this Portentia would always meet either outside of a brothel called the Cultured Corset, or outside an orphanage in town, the Guiding Light orphanage. The name of the orphanage is instantly familiar to the twins: it’s the one Sarya grew up in.  

The twins seem eager to pursue this lead, but Stormbreaker, Doloris and T’hau decide to prioritize the Heart. They know the ship the next map is on will be leaving later that day, so they head back to port to meet up with the captain and the rest of the crew, as Isol and Sarya head off towards the Cultured Corset. 

The crew meets up with the captain, Mal and Rayna on the ship, and they start discussing where to best lay an ambush.

Isol and Sarya head to the brothel first, and to the orphanage second. At the brothel, they find out from the owner that Portentia works out of the brothel from time to time, though she’s somewhat of a freelancer who has other, mostly wealthy clients, across the city. In fact, the Marquis used to be one of her clients.

At the orphanage, they break in and after looking around, Isol finds a number of interesting papers in the former office of the head of the orphanage. It seems Portentia and Prospero Alvaro are siblings, and the two of them were brought to this orphanage after a Revelry raid on their village presumably killed their parents. They were eventually picked up by an uncle, though this was much later.

Putting all the clues they’ve found together, the twins deduce that Portentia is likely Alvaro’s real spy master, with ties to a lot of wealthy families in the city. 

Meanwhile, the crew of the Serpent’s Tide has set sail and after about two and a half days, they have sailed around the peninsula and are now in position to lay their ambush. They know two ships will be incoming, both smaller ones with no canons, but manned by people of the Enchanted Gale, who likely have magic at their disposal. 

At Stormbreaker’s suggestion, they pull the ship as far to the shore as possible, waiting for the two ships to line up next to them. The two ships, the Stormhawk and the Cerulean Gauntlet (the one that has the map on it), eventually round the corner and approach, and the crew gets ready for their ambush.

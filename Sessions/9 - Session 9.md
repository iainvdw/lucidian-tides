More information about the aboleth would be found in a library or school. Was a naval academy in Open Quay. All of Concord's naval officers trained.

Stormbreaker tells me to ask for Klilla at the naval academy.

Walk to Open Quay, find building in scaffolding. Bell tower in ruins, stopped repairing it.

Enter building, statue in the hallway of a distinguished gentleman, with a spyglass. Tabaxi points me to a library down a hallway. Wooden desk between a double staircase, with a huge hall with a library behind it, but it has been in disrepair and soot stains are covering the ceiling.

Aarakocra woman behind desk, writing with a large quill. Introduces herself as Klilla Agrupnin. T'hau asks around for information on underwater civilizations, particularly of evil intent.

Start with looking over charts of explored ocean floor, starting with the location where [[T'hau]] came from. Place near Tal'Dorei, Ruins of Tempestar. Mention of Salar on map of western coast of Tal'Dorei, near Emon. Takes better part of the day, and eventually the Klilla comes back to tell the library is closing up. Asking to borrow the maps is met with a kind decline

Rayna asks Mal if she would join the council meeting, but Mal isn't sure as people might recognise her. It takes a sudden twist where they discuss the morality of burning people and the conflict  in what people have told Rayna before she joined the Revelry. The rest of the crew joins in when Rayna shouts around asking if anyone's good with disguises. Stormbreaker asks why that's needed and Mal reveals her real name is Louise de Montfort, and people think she's still dead. We eventually settle on a big hat for Mal to cover her face.

Mal heads to the Helm & Cloak to find Ava to tell her not to tell other folks that Mal isn't dead. Ava is surprised at the question, asking why she would want that. Mal explains that when her family made some deal and left Avernus early, they left Mal behind in Avernus. Ava finally understands.

Mal also asks Ava about a Mr. Ribbond, that Ava mentioned two nights earlier. Ava knows he has a twin brother, and an older brother. Mal reveals that the Ribbond family might be in cahoots with the Myriad. Ava's eyes flare up as she hears this. Mal asks if she knows what happened to Bartholomew, and Ava tells she heard about a murder in the harbour.

The crew heads to the council meeting. On one of the thoroughfairs, we hear a lot of shouting, a large group of people coming into the street on a cross section. Big burly hobgoblin leading around 18 people. Hobgoblin drags something along the streets. People behind him carry a coffin. Person hobgoblin is dragging is a dwarf, covered in coal stains.

People are chanting "Justice for Nivor!"

Skews are poorest neighbourhood in Nicodranas. Coming from west, heading east towards the park. Stormbreaker remembers that people aren't happy with dwarves starting up a mining business here.

Mal remembers the name Nivor as a tannery in the skews, where they treat leather. The tannery is fairly close to the property claimed for the dwarven mine.

Hobgoblin takes out a pistol, two of the eighteen people are Ziraj the orc and Feera the human, who we met last night.

Stormbreaker runs into the crowd and starts to rage, with lightning zapping the leading hobgoblin.

The crew tries to calm down the lynch mob. Dorrik the hobgoblin doesn't give in, and tells us they want justice for the dwarf blowing up two people from the Nivor tannery. Apparently guards aren't doing anything about it.

Guards arrive with a woman in coloured robes. The dwarf is helped up by the woman. Dwarf tells that the mob got him for an apparent murder. Guards apprehend Dorrik and take him away. Mal tells us that the woman was councillor Eda.

Council meeting opens. 

- First item is recent explosion. 
	- Eda stands up and tells she met the angry mob. Tensions are getting high. People are owed some form of justice. 
	- Modesto interjects that The Golden Chain might not be fit to handle these kind of situations.
	- Crowd bursts into uproar and Gellan Primewater tries to calm them down.
- Second item is demolition Lavish Chateau
	- Keep running into problems with hauntings in a few locations. A tower, graveyard and the Lavish Chateau.
	- Lord de Montfort opens up that the chateau is derelict, but it is still a piece of Nicodranas, a landmark. There's a number of other situations aren't handled, as it is haunted. Priests tried to handle the situation. Gellan Primewater suggests offering interested mercenaries and adventurers the job to handle.
- Third item is the rise of incoming immigrants seeking the boom town energy
	- Shirome suggests restricting the influx. Skew is already overrun, Nicodranas does not need more people for low skilled labour.
- Open questions from the crowd.
	- Stormbreaker raises the point about a terrorist attack on the tannery and what is being done about it. Lord Modesto replies with a smirk that they don't intend to investigate as there is no evidence.

Gellan Primewater eventually passes the gavel to lead the next council meeting. Lady Shirome tells that a guest is incoming, the grand admiral Alvaro is coming to attend the party for the completion of the keep.

Stormbreaker notes that Alvaro is not keen on attending parties and might be here for other business as well.

Gellan and Eda walk up to us on the balcony, Eda recognises us from earlier.

Find Eda during work hours at firebreather's guild, west of the park.

As we get back to the ship, we get a report from patrolling duties. Julnar was on watch, and tells he saw a parrot flying from the Mimsey as it was setting sail to leave port.

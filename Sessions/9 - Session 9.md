More information about the aboleth would be found in a library or school. Was a naval academy in Open Quay. All of Concord's naval officers trained.

Stormbreaker tells me to ask for Klilla at the naval academy.

Walk to Open Quay, find building in scaffolding. Bell tower in ruins, stopped repairing it.

Enter building, statue in the hallway of a distinguished gentleman, with a spyglass. Tabaxi points me to a library down a hallway. Wooden desk between a double staircase, with a huge hall with a library behind it, but it has been in disrepair and soot stains are covering the ceiling.

Aarakocra woman behind desk, writing with a large quill. Introduces herself as Klilla Agrupnin. T'hau asks around for 

Start with looking over charts of explored ocean floor, starting with the location where [[T'hau]] came from. Place near Tal'Dorei, Ruins of Tempestar. Mention of Salar on map of western coast of Tal'Dorei, near Emon. Takes better part of the day, and eventually the Klilla comes back to tell the library is closing up. Asking to borrow the maps is met with a kind decline

Rayna asks Mal if she would join the council meeting, but Mal isn't sure as people might recognise her. It takes a sudden twist where they discuss the morality of burning people and the conflict  in what people have told Rayna before she joined the Revelry. The rest of the crew joins in when Rayna shouts around asking if anyone's good with disguises. Stormbreaker asks why that's needed and Mal reveals her real name is Louise de Montfort, and people think she's still dead. We eventually settle on a big hat for Mal to cover her face.

Mal heads to the Helm & Cloak to find Ava to tell her not to tell other folks that Mal isn't dead. Ava is surprised at the question, asking why she would want that. Mal explains that when her family made some deal and left Avernus early, they left Mal behind in Avernus. Ava finally understands.

Mal also asks Ava about a Mr. Ribbond, that Ava mentioned two nights earlier. Ava knows he has a twin brother, and an older brother. Mal reveals that the Ribbond family might be in cahoots with the Myriad. Ava's eyes flare up as she hears this. Mal asks if she knows what happened to Bartholomew, and Ava tells she heard about a murder in the harbour.

The crew heads to the council meeting. On one of the thoroughfairs, we hear a lot of shouting, a large group of people coming into the street on a cross section. Big burly hobgoblin leading around 18 people. Hobgoblin drags something along the streets. People behind him carry a coffin. Person hobgoblin is dragging is a dwarf, covered in coal stains.

People are chanting "Justice for Nivor!"

Skews are poorest neighbourhood in Nicodranas. Coming from west, heading east towards the park. Stormbreaker remembers that people aren't happy with dwarves starting up a mining business here.

Mal remembers the name Nivor as a tannery in the skews, where they treat leather. The tannery is fairly close to the property claimed for the dwarven mine.

Hobgoblin takes out a pistol, two of the eighteen people are Ziraj the orc and Feera the human, who we met last night.

Stormbreaker runs into the crowd and starts to rage, with lightning zapping the leading hobgoblin.

The crew tries to calm down the lynch mob. Dorrik the hobgoblin doesn't give in, and tells us they want justice for the dwarf blowing up two people from the Nivor tannery. Apparently guards aren't doing anything about it.

The dwarf is picked up by the guard captain. Dwarf tells

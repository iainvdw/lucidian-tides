More information about the aboleth would be found in a library or school. Was a naval academy in Open Quay. All of Concord's naval officers trained.

Stormbreaker tells me to ask for Klilla Agrupnin at the naval academy.

Walk to Open Quay, find building in scaffolding. Bell tower in ruins, stopped repairing it.

Enter building, statue in the hallway of a distinguished gentleman, with a spyglass. Tabaxi points me to a library down a hallway. Wooden desk between a double staircase, with a huge hall with a library behind it, but it has been in disprepair and soot stains are covering the ceiling.

Aarakocra behind desk, writing with a large quill.

Start with looking over charts of explored ocean floor.

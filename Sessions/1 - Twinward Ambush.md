As we enter a lagoon at  [[The Gravid Archipelago]], they spot a sloop with four torches, which calls the ship to a halt before escorting them further into a sea cavern. There, they are greeted by [[‘Ole Thick]] to [[The Gravid Archipelago|'Ole Thick's Watering Hole]]. There are a few pirates already inside. The captain tells the crew to stretch their legs and find some drinks as he goes to handle some business. [[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]] buys everyone a round of drinks. 

As they’re having drinks, the crew overhears a conversation about some new [[Clovis Concord]] ships that ambushed one of Mr. Higgins’ ships. [[Doloris]] recognises this name, sharing that Mr. Higgins was the captain of one of the [[The Revelry|Revelry]]’s greatest fighting ships, the Belligerent. It seems that ship was sunk in this Clovid Concord ambush.

The captain soon returns, going over three options of cargo with the crew:
1. 1200gp worth of Marquisian spices
2. 1400gp worth of Tal'dorei ale (harder to smuggle, because bigger) 
3. Or 2300gp worth of Marquisian gold bars, which are going to be really hard to sell as they have a logo pressed into them from House Sherome

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] is familiar with the name of House Sherome, which is a noble family that isn’t native to Nicodranas. The head of the family is a wealthy business woman and there are rumours of her buying up old plots / houses in [[Nicodranas]] now that the city has returned from Avernus, subletting these places for outrageous amounts of money. 

The crew discusses which option to go for and who they could potentially sell this to. Though some of them are familiar with Nicodranas, none of them have specific contacts they could sell to. Doloris suggests asking [[Remmi Rattlebones|Remmi]] if he knows of anyone, which he says he does.

Remmi shares that he’s familiar with two options for smuggling items into the city: The Candlehollow family (a family of undertakers who use coffins to smuggle things into and out of the city) as well as a location called The Undercellar, which is a maze of storage chambers and cellars underneath the Restless Wharf. 

When it comes to people who would be interested in buying their goods, he knows of a Mister Primewater, though it’s not someone he’s personally too familiar with. Mallory recognises this name, knowing the man’s full name to be Gellan Primewater. He is originally from Nicodranas, moved away, but came back after Nicodranas returned from Avernus. She knows this name because he was previously stationed out of [[Port Damali]]. 

As they continue discussing Nicodranas, Doloris shares she knows of a way into the city by sea, through a temple of Melora. This would potentially mean they can avoid the harbour, which would mean they don’t have to pay the 40% Nicodranas taxes. But they would have to dock first to find the contact before continuing on to smuggle the payload to the temple, without having actual business in the harbour. This might be deemed suspicious behaviour by the Clovis Concord, which might taint the name of the new ship and its crew immediately.

The crew eventually decides to go with the ale and to try and legitimately sell this cargo, hoping to make connections in Nicodranas when they get there so they can consider more illicit dealings for future trades. With this decision made, they have some more drinks, mingling with the other pirates at the bar, who they learn are the crew of the Dragon Fang, captained by Captain Laskillar. They’re the ones who collect the cargos that other pirates can then pick up here. 

After loading the ale onto the ship, the crew continues on their way towards the [[Twinward Isles]].

During the week’s travel there, everyone tries to pick up some new skills and make themselves familiar with the ship and it’s weaponry. [[T'hau]] organises a cannon drill to get the crew acquainted with its weaponry for the ambush ahead. T'hau is joined by the four deckhands and asks for one of the others to fully man the third cannon. [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] joins in to complete the crew for the third cannon and complete the drill successfully.

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]] wants to get some experience with forging documents, and starts with recreating the documents for the Tal'dorei ale. She is joined by [[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]] who guides her through the whole process and they create new documents for the shipment.

After seven days travel, they reach the Twinward Isles. There, they start looking for a good place for an ambush, Doloris pointing out two spots that will allow them a good position:
- an inlet which we can use for a surprise attack
- from around the island and approach head on, to keep suspicion low

After deciding on Doloris’ second suggestion, they lower the anchor for now, knowing the Relentless is still some two days out. [[Big Neela]] suggests she be on watch from the sea and will return when she spots the ship. During these days , we decided to mask the ship's name and [[Odell Blackmoore]] offers to cover up the name to avoid raising future suspicion.

After the two days pass, Neela returns to the ship, alerting everyone that she’s spotted the Relentless. The crew set their plan in motion, passing by the ship before attacking, firing their cannons at the other ship’s sail, and breaking the main mast. As the ship rounds behind  The Relentless, [[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] sets fire to the back sail, severely hampering its manoeuverability. Then the captain gives the order to board the ship, and using boarding hooks they swing across to the other ship.

On board, we see a [[Clovis Concord]] commander, captain, crew and a Zhelezo lieutenant with  some guards. The commander grabs his sword and pistol as soon as he sees us. We focus on the commander and lieutenant first and manage to knock the commander unconscious. We kill the [[Zhelezo]] lieutenant on deck, after he manages to shout at the Zhelezo to run downstairs towards the prisoners. [[Mallory Calder|Mal]] and [[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]] follow the Zhelezo guard downstairs.

[[T'hau]] runs up to the captain to tell the deckhands to back off the cannons, as [[The Serpent's Tide]] is about to pass by The Relentless. Not immediately backing down, T'hau attacks the captain to show they mean business, and this finally gets the crew to back away. Afterwards, T'hau follows Mal and Bartholomew below deck.

[[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] and [[Doloris]] keep the deck situation under control, fighting off the remaining Zhelezo and rounding up the crew on deck.

[[Mallory Calder|Mal]], [[Bartholomew Brittlestone|Bartholomew]] and [[T'hau]] go in pursuit of the fleeing Zhelezo guard. The guard runs downstairs and shouts that we're incoming and to get ready. Running after the guard, we find ourselves facing another lieutenant, and ten more Zhelezo guards. 

Behind the guards, we see a number of cells with people in them. Shouting comes from one of the cells. Bartholomew runs around the guard towards the cell, and deftly manages to open the lock, freeing two more [[The Revelry|Revelry]] pirates who were taken captive.

[[Rayna Khatri|Rayna]] followed us downstairs and sees us outnumbered by the guard. In a raging blaze she takes down seven guards at once, causing the remaining guards and lieutenant to fear for their lives, surrendering to us.

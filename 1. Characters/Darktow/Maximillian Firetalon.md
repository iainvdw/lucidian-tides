Captain of The Blind Sphinx. Crew of the ship caused trouble at [[The Muddy Hut]].

Firetalon as a captain's name is well known. Ship doesn't come in very regularly, hunts Concord and merchants alike, doesn't care about their targets. Dumps their loot at [[The Gravid Archipelago|'Ole Thick's Watering Hole]] for maximum profits. 

[[Doloris]] heard rumour that they get tips about who to hunt from someone from Stillben, but it seems a bit unusual as it's a hotbed for [[Myriad|The Myriad]] activity.

A female sea elf cleric of Ioun. Regular patron of [[The Muddy Hut]] in [[Darktow]] whenever she's near or in town. Otherwise resides in [[Port Damali]], providing her services from a [[The Revelry|Revelry]] safe house.

Although Alma is not officially affiliated to the [[Cobalt Soul]], she has established connections there with various monks and clerics during her previous visits to the library.

During [[T'hau]]'s escape from the aboleth's clutches, they met Alma when they stumbled upon an encampment of some Valraean Protectorate nomads. As this was her first time seeing a K'thaumi, something sparked Alma's interest, and she contacted T'hau and their friends to learn more of their origin. Over the next few days, Alma acted as their guide there, showing them around the camp and introducing them to some other nomads.

After a few days at camp, the nomads decided it was time to move on from this spot, and the K'thaumi continued their travels again, searching for a safe place far away from where they came from. Before saying goodbye to her newfound friends, Alma directed them to [[Darktow]], which she knew as a safe haven for various misfits and pirates, and figured they would be welcome there.

Some time later, when the Valraean Protectorate nomads neared Darktow Isle, Alma was contacted by the [[Cobalt Soul]]. Specifically, she was invited to come to [[Port Damali]] by a monk named [[Isol]].

Before she left for Port Damali, Alma decided to make a quick visit to Darktow. Wondering if her new friends had safely arrived there, she decided to ask around some taverns and inns, and finally came across [[The Muddy Hut]]. There, she finally saw a few familiar faces when she saw [[Lg'hun 'Pock'|Pock]] was running the place, and [[T'hau]] was sitting at the bar enjoying a drink. They spoke for a while, talking about T'hau's travels and how they settled in Darktow. T'hau, in return, acted as a guide for Alma in Darktow, introducing them to various people of [[The Revelry]]. 

On one occasion, T'hau introduced Alma to [[Plank Queen Yucalia]]. A long conversation ensued about Alma's history with the Valraean Protectorate, why she came to Darktow and other matters. Alma mentioned that she was on her way to Port Damali, as she was invited by a monk from the [[Cobalt Soul]]. The Plank Queen saw something in Alma and her travels to Port Damali, and offered her a position in The Revelry acting as an agent from a safe house there. Alma would be free to do her studies, research and provide her services from there, as long as she would inform The Revelry on [[Clovis Concord|Concord]] activity.

After a few days hanging out with [[T'hau]] and their friends, Alma left for [[Port Damali]]. She mentioned to T'hau that they would be welcome to visit her if they would ever be in the area.

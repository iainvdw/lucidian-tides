![[alma.png]]

A female sea elf cleric of Ioun. Regular patron of [[The Muddy Hut]] in [[Darktow]] whenever she's near or in town. Otherwise resides in [[Port Damali]], providing her services from a [[The Revelry|Revelry]] safe house.

Although Alma is not officially affiliated to the [[Cobalt Soul]], she has established connections there with various monks and clerics during her previous visits to the library.

During [[T'hau]]'s escape from the aboleth's clutches, they met Alma when they stumbled upon an encampment of some Valraean Protectorate nomads. As this was her first time seeing a K'thaumi, something sparked Alma's interest, and she contacted T'hau and their friends to learn more of their origin. Over the next few days, Alma acted as their guide there, showing them around the camp and introducing them to some other nomads. During this time, Alma and the K'thaumi bonded a bit and early signs of a friendship could be seen developing.

After a short stay in the camp, T'hau and their friends decided it was time to continue their travels again, searching for a safe place far away from where they came from. Alma directed them to [[Darktow]], which she knew as a safe haven for various misfits and pirates, and figured they would be welcome there.

Some time later, when the Valraean Protectorate nomads neared Darktow Isle, Alma was contacted by the [[Cobalt Soul]]. Specifically, she was invited to come to [[Port Damali]] by a monk named [[Isol]].

Before she left for Port Damali, Alma decided to make a quick visit to Darktow. Wondering if her new friends had safely arrived there, she decided to ask around some taverns and inns, and finally came across [[The Muddy Hut]]. There, she finally saw a few familiar faces when she saw [[Lg'hun 'Pock'|Pock]] was running the place, and [[T'hau]] was sitting at the bar enjoying a drink. They spoke for a while, talking about T'hau's travels and how they settled in Darktow. Alma then mentioned she had to leave for a while as she was invited by the [[Cobalt Soul]] in [[Port Damali]] for some important matters.

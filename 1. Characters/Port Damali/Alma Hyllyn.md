A female sea elf cleric of Ioun. Regular patron of [[The Muddy Hut]] in [[Darktow]] whenever she's near or in town. Otherwise resides in [[Port Damali]], providing her services from a [[The Revelry|Revelry]] safe house.

Although Alma is not officially affiliated to the [[Cobalt Soul]], she has established connections there with various monks and clerics during her previous visits to the library.

During [[T'hau]]'s escape from the aboleth's clutches, they met Alma when they stumbled upon an encampment of some Valraean Protectorate nomads. As this was her first time seeing a K'thaumi, something sparked Alma's interest, and she contacted T'hau and their friends to learn more of their origin. Over the next few days, Alma acted as their guide, showing them around the camp and introducing them to other people.

After a short stay in the camp, T'hau decided it was time to continue their travels again, searching for a safe place far away from where they came from. Alma directed them to [[Darktow]], which she knew as a safe haven for various misfits and pirates, and figured they would be welcome there.

Some time later, when the Valraean Protectorate nomads neared Darktow Isle, Alma was contacted by the [[Cobalt Soul]]

Alma decided to make a quick visit to Darktow. Wondering if their new friend had safely arrived there, she decided to ask around some taverns and inns, and finally came across [[The Muddy Hut]]. There, she saw familiar faces as she saw [[Lg'hun 'Pock'|Pock]] was running the place, and [[T'hau]] sitting at the bar enjoying a drink. They spoke for a while, talking about T'hau's travels and how they settled in Darktow.

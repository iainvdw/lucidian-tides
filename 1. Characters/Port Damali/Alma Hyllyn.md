A female sea elf cleric of Ioun. Regular patron of [[The Muddy Hut]] in [[Darktow]] whenever she's near or in town. Otherwise resides in [[Port Damali]], providing her services from a [[The Revelry|Revelry]] safe house.

Although Alma is not officially affiliated to the [[Cobalt Soul]], she has established connections there with various monks and clerics during her previous visits to the library.

During [[T'hau]]'s escape from the aboleth's clutches, they met Alma when they stumbled upon a sea elf city of the Valraean Protectorate, by the name of XXX. As this was her first time seeing a K'thaumi, something sparked Alma's interest, and she contacted T'hau and their friends to learn more of their origin. Over the next few days, Alma acted as their guide, showing them around the city.

After a short stay in XXX, T'hau continued their travels again, searching for a safe place far away from where they came from. Alma directed them to [[Darktow]], a safe haven for misfits and pirates, but otherwise very accepting of folks of all origins.

Some time later, Alma came to visit Darktow, wondering if their new friend had arrived there.

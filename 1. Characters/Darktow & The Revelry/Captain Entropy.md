Captain Entropy is a [[The Revelry|Revelry]] captain sailing a ship which is being pulled by a couple of manta rays.

When the crew was in [[Darktow]], Entropy shared with [[T'hau]] that he was interested in visiting the naval academy's library in [[Nicodranas]]. T'hau then shared that he has some books and documents from the academy already, namely on the Remnant of Salar. Entropy was very surprised to hear that name, as that was also the topic he wanted to research.

Former Aboleth guard, fled together with [T'hau](../The%20party/T'hau.md)'s group. Cocky, aggressive, ruthless.

Now a pirate sailing around [Darktow](../../2.%20Locations/Darktow%20Isle/Darktow.md), raiding Concord vessels and guarding the waterways around Darktow Isle. Ruthless and violent towards opponents. Got the nickname 'Snip' as they once snipped off a head with their pincers during a fight.

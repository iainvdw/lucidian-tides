The adventure begins in [Darktow](../2.%20Locations/Darktow%20Isle/Darktow.md), a town of pirates on the island of the same name, Darktow Isle. The island is run by a pirate organisation calling themselves [The Revelry](../3.%20Factions/The%20Revelry.md). Recently, construction finished on the first ship coming out of Darktow's own shipyard, which has been named [The Serpent's Tide](../2.%20Locations/Darktow%20Isle/The%20Serpent's%20Tide.md).

[Captain Sariel](../1.%20People/Serpent's%20Tide/Captain%20Cassian%20Sariel%20de%20Rochefort.md) and his quartermaster [Bartholomew Brittlestone](../1.%20People/The%20party/Bartholomew%20Brittlestone.md) are summoned to The Roost by the [Plank Queen Yucalia](../1.%20People/Darktow/Plank%20Queen%20Yucalia.md). Yucalia briefs them on a new mission: intercept the prisoner transport of a [Clovis Concord](../3.%20Factions/Clovis%20Concord.md) defector and free them. The ship is they're being transported on is called The Relentless. Afterwards, we should sail on to meet with [Tamulia](../1.%20People/Nicodranas/Tamulia.md) in [Nicodranas](../2.%20Locations/Menagerie%20Coast/Nicodranas.md), and find a way to keep the port open for Revelry business.

The crew meet up on the upper floor of a tavern called the [The Keel Hall](../2.%20Locations/Darktow%20Isle/The%20Keel%20Hall.md). There, Captain Sariel lays down a map on the table and briefs us all on the mission. First we intercept the prisoner transport. Captain suggests we lay ambush at the Twinward Isles as the ship sails from Nicodranas to Port Damali and has to sail past that island.

On the way to the Twinward Isles, we are picking up some cargo from [‘Ole Thick](../1.%20People/Lucidian%20Ocean/%E2%80%98Ole%20Thick.md) in [The Gravid Archipelago](../2.%20Locations/Lucidian%20Ocean/The%20Gravid%20Archipelago.md) to sell later on in [Nicodranas](../2.%20Locations/Menagerie%20Coast/Nicodranas.md). The captain lists a number of options for who to sell the cargo to. There is the [Clovis Concord](../3.%20Factions/Clovis%20Concord.md), who would impose a hefty tax on our earnings. Or we could try to sell it ourselves to some Revelry contacts, risking angering the [Clovis Concord](../3.%20Factions/Clovis%20Concord.md).

When we finally get to Nicodranas, we have to figure out a way to keep the port open for Revelry business, as the Clovis Concord is cracking down hard on any kind of piracy or smuggling activity in the city and its surrounding water. We should meet up there with [Tamulia](../1.%20People/Nicodranas/Tamulia.md) and see what going on there.

After the briefing, Captain Sariel stays upstairs with [Bartholomew](../1.%20People/The%20party/Bartholomew%20Brittlestone.md), [Mallory](../1.%20People/The%20party/Mallory%20Calder.md) and [Doloris](../1.%20People/The%20party/Doloris.md) to hire some new crew here for the mission. Captain Sariel asks them to come forward so they can take a look at them. Eight individuals of various origins present themselves. Bartholomew asks a tabaxi to come forwards and introduce themselves, but are immediately dismissed again as soon as Bartholomew hears the tabaxi's nagging voice, telling them they can't stand to hear that for weeks when at sea.

From the remaining individuals, the following is selected as our crew:

* A whale person woman called [Big Neela](../1.%20People/Serpent's%20Tide/Big%20Neela.md), who has their own grudge with the [Clovis Concord](../3.%20Factions/Clovis%20Concord.md)
* A human woman called [Julnar Norra](../1.%20People/Serpent's%20Tide/Julnar%20Norra.md) with a forked tongue, who once had a run in with some Yuan'ti.
* A dwarven man and renowned Revelry pirate [Odell Blackmoore](../1.%20People/Serpent's%20Tide/Odell%20Blackmoore.md), who's known for single-handedly blowing up a Clovis Concord ship and escaping alive.
* A goblin man from Xorhas called [Remmi Rattlebones](../1.%20People/Serpent's%20Tide/Remmi%20Rattlebones.md), originally from [Nicodranas](../2.%20Locations/Menagerie%20Coast/Nicodranas.md) before the city got transported to Avernus.

Music and laughter can be heard downstairs in the tavern, [Rayna](../1.%20People/The%20party/Rayna%20Khatri.md) and [T'hau](../1.%20People/The%20party/T'hau.md) go downstairs to check it out. A pair of halflings are playing music on top of a table, singing a jolly song. T'hau takes our their hand drum and joins in on the music, providing an exciting rhythm to the tune for the crowd to enjoy.

On the other side of the tavern, Rayna sits at a table playing Three Dragon Ante, where she's facing off an opponent in a duel. A large sum of money is already in the pot, a total of 26 gold is at stake. Rayna thinks she has a pretty good hand, and then against all odds, the dwarf bets all in. Looking at his face, Rayna spots a slight tell and thinks the dwarf is bluffing, so calls him on his bet. When the cards are thrown on the table, it shows that Rayna did have the better hand and hauls in the winnings. Quite the sore loser, the dwarf then challenges Rayna for a final bet, the winner takes double the pot, the loser gets a knife through their hand. Not taking the dwarf up on this bet, she politely thanks the dwarf in a sarcastic way and leaves the table to join the crew upstairs.

The following days, the crew prepare themselves for the journey ahead and load the ship with everything they need for the mission. Then [The Serpent's Tide](../2.%20Locations/Darktow%20Isle/The%20Serpent's%20Tide.md) sets off on her maiden journey and sails out Darktow's port onto the Lucidian Ocean.

After a few days of travel, the crew find themselves near some isles to the north. A crumbling tower is spotted on top of an island, called the Last Watch. A screech is suddenly heard from the sky, as a mother griffon and four of her children swoop in and attack the crew in search of a meal. The experienced crew quite easily takes care of the griffons. The crew then butchers the mother griffon for some fresh griffon steak.

Eventually the crew sails onwards and travels towards the [The Gravid Archipelago](../2.%20Locations/Lucidian%20Ocean/The%20Gravid%20Archipelago.md) to meet up with [‘Ole Thick](../1.%20People/Lucidian%20Ocean/%E2%80%98Ole%20Thick.md).

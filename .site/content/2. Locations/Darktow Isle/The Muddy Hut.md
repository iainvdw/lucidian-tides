Starting out as a simple sea grotto and beach shack in [Darktow](Darktow.md) where [T'hau](../../1.%20People/The%20party/T'hau.md) and their friends made their living quarters, it soon attracted more and more folks because of their unusual origin. Folks became acquainted, befriended, and over time more and more folks flocked to this place.

This led to the conversion of the shack into a tavern of sorts. Built deeper into the cave and further out into the sea, it grew over time into a tavern frequented by folks of a more aquatic origin.

The tavern is run by [Pock](../../1.%20People/Darktow/Lg'hun%20'Pock'.md), a lobster-like K't'haumi, and close friend of T'hau.
